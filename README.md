# Getting Started

This section outlines the initial setup and two primary modes of operation for this project.

## Initial Setup

* **Obtain Alpaca API Tokens**
    * Access to Alpaca's API is crucial for fetching real-time and historical financial data. These tokens are typically sensitive and should be handled securely.
    * *Note: This token can be difficult to obtain; if needed, we may provide it directly.*

* **Configure Environment Variables**
    * Download the provided `.env` file and place it in the root directory of this repository. This file will contain necessary credentials and configuration settings.

## Project Operation Modes

Once the initial setup is complete, you have two distinct modes of operation, each serving a different purpose:

### 1. Real-time Dashboard Monitoring

* This mode allows you to observe real-time data flows and visualize insights directly from the project's dashboard.
* To launch the real-time monitoring, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -f docker-compose.realtime.yml
    ```

### 2. Historical Data Training and Analysis

* This mode is designed for training machine learning models using historical data and performing in-depth analysis. It involves downloading historical data and initiating the training process.
* To execute historical data training and analysis, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -f docker-compose.training.yml
    ```

## Extending Company Tickers

The project is designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily add new companies for analysis.

* **Database Integration**: The project centralizes ticker and company information within a database. To add a new company, simply insert a new record into the `tickers` table in the PostgreSQL database.
    * The required fields are `ticker_symbol` and `company_name`.
    * The `id` (which serves as `ticker_code` in the model) will be automatically generated by the database.

    Example SQL insertion:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO tickers (ticker_symbol, company_name) VALUES
    ('GOOG', 'Alphabet Inc.');
    ```
    * Upon the next run of the training or real-time process, the system will automatically fetch this new entry from the database and incorporate it into the analysis. This dynamic approach ensures that all modules requiring ticker information (e.g., data ingestion, model training) stay synchronized with the latest list of companies.
