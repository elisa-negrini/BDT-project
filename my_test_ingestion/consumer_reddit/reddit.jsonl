The probe centers around a $32 million software deal tied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), sparking investor concerns about the company’s business practices and future government partnerships.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the Department of the Treasury’s inspector general is investigating the role [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) played in a procurement process that allegedly skipped competitive bidding rules. The deal was executed through Carahsoft, a major government IT contractor, and involved CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software being fast-tracked into IRS systems.\n\nThe issue? Investigators are trying to determine if the deal improperly bypassed [federal acquisition regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/), which require fair competition for most government contracts. So far, no formal accusations have been made, but the existence of an active investigation is enough to rattle stakeholders.\n\nOnce news of the probe broke, CrowdStrike’s stock dropped by nearly 5% in intraday trading. The sharp decline reflects investor anxiety over potential reputational damage, contract delays, or future revenue losses tied to government scrutiny.\n\nThis development comes at a time when CrowdStrike is viewed as a major player in protecting public and private institutions from cyber threats. Any disruption to that perception could shift market dynamics in favor of competitors.\n\n# What This Means for the Cybersecurity Industry\n\nGovernment contracts are a huge revenue source for cybersecurity firms. But as this situation highlights, they can also come with regulatory risks. The scrutiny CrowdStrike now faces serves as a warning to other tech firms: follow proper procurement procedures, or face financial and legal consequences.\n\nAnalysts say this probe might not spell long-term doom for CrowdStrike, especially if no wrongdoing is ultimately found. Still, it’s a reminder that trust and transparency are as critical as innovation in today’s tech-driven economy.", "score": 143, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1746832494.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1kiw51u/crowdstrike_faces_federal_investigation_stock/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiw51u/crowdstrike_faces_federal_investigation_stock/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

They envision the Department of Defense taking a prominent role in ordering reactors and installing them on military bases.\n\nThey would also set a goal of quadrupling the size of the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants, from nearly 100 gigawatts of electric capacity today to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: \"We don't see that happening.\" \"We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,\" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: \"I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.\"\n\n&gt; Trump's remark on Mattel \"trying to go somewhere else,\" and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of China.", "score": 4648, "num_comments": 477, "created_utc": 1746827147.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1kiu8i8/trump_has_threatened_to_place_a_100_tariff_on/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiu8i8/trump_has_threatened_to_place_a_100_tariff_on/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

You may not be able to learn to perform every operation perfectly, but learning technical indicators can often help you avoid making wrong decisions.  \nThe first thing you need to do is to overlay the Bollinger Bands in your trading application. This will display the simple moving average for the past 20 days, as well as the upper and lower limits that reflect price fluctuations. In 90% of cases, stocks will fluctuate within these ranges.  \nThe other thing you need to do is to turn on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). If you are using a certain trading platform, both the RSI and the Bollinger Bands can be found under the \"Research\" option. You just need to add them, and then you can see them when viewing any stock. Generally speaking, the RSI will show whether a stock is in an overbought state (greater than 70) or an oversold state (less than 30). Although you should treat this indicator with caution, it can more stably help you avoid making wrong decisions and may also assist you in making some correct decisions.  \nIf you haven't done so yet, I suggest you change the lines on the chart to candlestick charts. Use a daily candlestick chart on a wider timeline and a 5-minute candlestick chart on the daily chart. Candlestick charts can tell you more about price movements than just a single line. Each candlestick tells a complete story, so learn how to interpret them.  \nIf you haven't learned how to read and set these indicators yet, it's time to take it seriously. If you haven't learned how to read candlestick charts, you should also learn how to set them. I promise, it's not difficult. It's like the difference between looking at a black-and-white photo and watching a full-color movie.  \nHowever, I sincerely hope you can benefit from our communication: set these indicators (RSI and Bollinger Bands) on your trading platform and change the lines on the chart to candlestick lines, which should help you reduce losses!", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1746826897.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1kiu59b/mastering_the_basics_using_rsi_bollinger_bands/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kiu59b/mastering_the_basics_using_rsi_bollinger_bands/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

{"id": "1ki0es0", "title": "Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical", "author": "Puginator", "text": "There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.\n\nData analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.\n\nMicrosoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.\n\nPalantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&amp;P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.\n\nPalantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.\n\nIn an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”\n\n“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.\n\nBut investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.\n\nThat all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.\n\n“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.\n\nAmong the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.\n\nPalantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.\n\n“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/palantir-joins-top-10-most-valuable-tech-companies-stock-at-premium.html)", "score": 466, "num_comments": 164, "created_utc": 1746736255.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1ki0es0/palantir_now_among_10_most_valuable_us_tech/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ki0es0/palantir_now_among_10_most_valuable_us_tech/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

Let's see some details though, not just \"Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars.\" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... \n\nI'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! \n\nEdit: I'll start with mine. \n\nSearch- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.\n\nYouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.\n\nCloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. \n\nGoogle networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.\n\nOther -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?\n\nBalance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? \n\nSo, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time.

The company's marquee release for the period, Bong Joon Ho's sci-fi dark comedy \"Mickey 17,\" earned only slightly more than its reported budget at the box office.\nThat meant studios revenue fell 18% to $2.31 billion, missing estimates of $2.73 billion, according to Visible Alpha.\nThe company has, however, made a strong start to the second quarter with Ryan Coogler's horror film \"Sinners\" and the blockbuster \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which has raked in around $900 million globally, making it the biggest release of 2025 so far. Its summer lineup also looks strong with \"Superman,\" directed by Marvel's long-time hitmaker James Gunn, set to release in July.\nRevenue at the TV networks segment, which includes CNN, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, fell 7%, with advertising revenue in the business declining 12% as marketers avoided cable TV amid cord-cutting by subscribers.\nOverall, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of 2025 to $8.98 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $9.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Loss of 18 cents per share was also larger than expectations for a 13-cent loss, even as costs declined 11.8%.\nThe company's shares were down 1.9% in premarket trading.\nStill, its streaming business was a bright spot.\nWBD added 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, compared with 3.1 million estimated by analysts, according to Visible Alpha, taking its total to 122.3 million. The quarter featured some strong content slate including the third season of HBO's \"The White Lotus\" and the medical drama series \"The Pitt\".\nThe company also launched its Max streaming service in Australia earlier this year, following rollouts in more than 70 countries across Europe and Asia last year. Analysts say it has also benefited and reduced churn thanks to a streaming bundle combining Disney+, Hulu and Max that was introduced last year.\nReporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta", "score": 23, "num_comments": 14, "created_utc": 1746709421.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1khpl2n/warner_bros_discovery_misses_revenue_estimates_on/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1khpl2n/warner_bros_discovery_misses_revenue_estimates_on/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

{"id": "1khov4k", "title": "Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles as it gears up for launch", "author": "Puginator", "text": "Nintendo said Thursday that it expects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026.\n\nIt is the first forecast for sales from the Japanese gaming giant since it announced the successor to its successful Switch device, which is due to go on sale in June.\n\nNintendo also reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full year. Here’s how Nintendo did in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Mar. 31 versus LSEG estimates:\n\n* **Revenue**: 208.7 billion Japanese yen ($1.45 billion), compared with 216.16 billion yen expected.\n* **Net profit:** 41.6 billion yen, versus 33.91 billion yen expected.\n\nRevenue fell 24.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, while profit plunged nearly 50%. This was largely expected as Nintendo fans await the Switch 2 and hold off on buying the current console.\n\nEarlier this year Nintendo slashed its forecast for sales of the Switch to 11 million units for the year ended Mar. 31. Nintendo on Thursday said it sold 10.8 million units of the Switch in the year, just shy of its own forecast and down 31% year-on-year.\n\nMarket research firm Omdia expects Nintendo to sell 14.7 million Switch 2 units in 2025 alone, which would be about 10% ahead of the original Switch’s debut year.\n\n“Switch 2 will launch into a stronger position than its predecessor, with over 100 million active Switch users providing a strong foundation for adoption,” George Jijiashvili, Omdia’s senior principal analyst, told CNBC by email.\n\n# Tariffs in focus\n\nInvestors are also focused on Nintendo’s forecast for the fiscal year. The company expects net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise but just short of LSEG estimates of 2 trillion yen. It expects net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen, below LSEG estimates of 388.8 billion yen.\n\nHowever, Nintendo noted that all of its forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10 — following a pause in U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs for many countries.\n\nNintendo in April delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. Nintendo’s consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces duties of 46% once the pause lifts.\n\nNintendo’s President Shuntaro Furukawa said on Thursday that if additional tariffs are imposed and prices of its goods need to be adjusted, demand in the U.S. may decrease, Reuters reported. Duties could hit profit to the tune of tens of billions of yen, Furukawa added, according to the report.\n\nSerkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, said Nintendo’s forecasts are typically conservative.\n\n“Nintendo loves lowballing their forecasts, and the current climate around tariffs gives them all the reason to be more cautious than ever,” Toto told CNBC.\n\nHe added that tariffs are creating an “unclear future” for Nintendo, making it “impossible” for any hardware maker to make sales predictions.\n\n“What happens if the tariffs on imports from China stay this high for longer or if they are raised for Vietnam?” Toto said.\n\n“If Nintendo needed to raise prices by $100 or more, all bets would be off and the company would be under enormous pressure in the all important U.S. market.”\n\n# Switch 2 fuels stock rally\n\nInvestors are now focused on how the successor to the console, the Switch 2, will perform following its launch. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has improved features compared with its predecessor.\n\nAs well as the 15 million unit sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026, Nintendo said it expects to sell 45 million units of software during the same period.\n\nGames are important for the success of any console and Nintendo said the Switch 2 will launch with two titles — “Mario Kart World” and “Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.” There will also be Switch 2 versions of existing games such as “Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Nintendo is leaning on its popular characters such as Mario and Zelda to boost the appeal of the Switch 2.\n\nNintendo first launched the original Switch in 2017 and it has become the Japanese gaming giant’s second-best-selling console ever with over 150 million units sold. The firm managed to extend the life of the hardware thanks to hit games involving characters like Super Mario, franchises such as Pokemon and the expansion of its intellectual property into films.\n\nInvestors are hopeful the company can continue to ride its wave of popularity with shares up around 30% this year and 64% over the past 12 months.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/nintendo-forecasts-sales-of-15-million-units-for-switch-2-console.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/nintendo-forecasts-sales-of-15-million-units-for-switch-2-console.html)", "score": 33, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1746707319.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1khov4k/nintendo_forecasts_sales_of_15_million_switch_2/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1khov4k/nintendo_forecasts_sales_of_15_million_switch_2/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

The Trump administration will not enforce that framework when it takes effect on May 15, according to people familiar with the matter, and is instead drafting its own version of the rules that’s likely to focus on direct negotiations with nations like the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe policy debate, which remains ongoing, centers on the question of how to regulate semiconductor shipments to places outside of China. Both Trump and Biden officials have sought to crack down on Beijing’s semiconductor ambitions, over concerns that advanced chip and AI technology could lend China a military edge. \n\nScrapping the AI diffusion framework won’t change the measures targeting China, which Trump recently toughened. Rather, it would provide fresh opportunities for other countries to negotiate their own chip access, as governments around the world seek to develop domestic AI capabilities.

And as direct as that is, it doesn't do us much good in a scenario where the bearish and bullish indicators are both priced in and weigh about the same.\n\nImagine two forces pushing against one another and a slight dominance constantly shifts back and forth between them. Then as headlines come out, large shifts in pressure occur in either direction depending on the news. This is volatility.\n\nThe volatility is the easy part to understand, it's the nearly equal, simultaneous pressure of bullish and bearish pricing of the market that is more difficult for people to grasp. Most people seem to think one thing is priced in or not. That's not how it works. Everything is priced in, it's just a matter of what is more priced in. Bullish sentiment or bearish? And if you're a trader, are you fast enough to ride the waves of the headlines?\n\nPerfect evidence of this can be found by looking at investment strategies of large firms. Many large firms hold conflicting strategies with each other. Some are pricing in more defensive allocations while others are still more offensive. Both are, and should be, very diversified in regard to market sentiment.\n\nThe more diversified the portfolio, the more balanced the market forces that are being applied to said portfolio.

Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)\n\n[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.\n\n[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)\\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday’s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff. For now, nothing has really changed my mind about covering my short unless we have a massive turn. Government spending cuts are the main risk for the company.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1746623693.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1kgx2ai/057_interesting_stocks_today_china_market_stimulus/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kgx2ai/057_interesting_stocks_today_china_market_stimulus/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

Shares fell about 5% following the report.\n\nHere’s how Uber did versus analysts’ estimates compiled by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 83 cents vs. 50 cents expected.\n* **Revenue:** $11.53 billion vs. $11.62 billion expected.\n\nRevenue at the ride-sharing company grew about 14% in the first three months of 2025, up from $10.13 billion during the same period in 2024.\n\nThe company also reported net income of around $1.78 billion or 83 cents per share during the first three months of 2025, up from a net loss of $654 million, or a loss of 32-cent loss per share, during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and CFO ‭Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said they expect gross bookings to reach between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion during the current quarter, with EBITDA in the range of $2.02 billion to $2.12 billion for that period.\n\nIn April, the Federal Trade Commission sued Uber and accused the company of “deceptive billing and cancellation practices” around its subscription service called Uber One.\n\n“It’s a bit of a head-scratcher for us,” Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.\n\nHe said 60% of the company’s gross bookings in its Uber Eats business come from Uber One members, and that the subscription service is growing quickly.\n\n“The suit alleges that some people don’t realize that they’re signing up or cancellations are difficult, but I’d encourage you to go experience it yourself,” Khosrowshahi said. “It’s very, very simple. You take a couple of steps to be able to cancel if you want.”\n\nUber’s largest business segments, which include its ride-hailing business and food and grocery delivery service, saw bookings increase year-over-year.\n\nHere are the key segment numbers:\n\n* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $21.18 billion, up 13% year over year\n* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $20.38 billion, up 15% year over year\n\nThe company also said its “monthly active platform consumers,” had grown to 170 million, up 14% from the first quarter of last year. Users booked around 3.04 billion “trips” during the first quarter of 2025, up 18% from the first quarter of 2024.\n\nUber told employees at the end of April that they would have to come into the office three days a week instead of two, including some remote staffers. The company also announced changes to its month-long paid sabbatical benefit, raising the requirement from five years at the company to eight years. \n\nKhosrowshahi defended the policy changes at a heated all-hands meeting last week, as CNBC previously reported.\n\n“Our company is executing really well, but we need to be at our top of our game and that means people working together in the office,” he told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nUber has also been making a push into autonomous vehicles, or AV technology. Khosrowshahi said the company views AVs as “the single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber.”\n\nUber allows app users to book robotaxi rides in some U.S. markets, or order food for delivery via autonomous vehicle in others.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Uber reached an “annual run-rate” of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.\n\nIn March, the company began to offer users in Austin, Texas the option to hail a robotaxi from its partner, Alphabet-owned Waymo exclusively via the Uber platform.\n\nKhosrowshahi said the Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as far as completed trips per day.\n\nBesides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta.\n\n“Supported by the consistent strength of our core business, we continue to build towards the future, including five new autonomous vehicle announcements in just the last week,” Khosrowshahi said in a release.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/uber-uber-q1-2025-earnings.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/uber-uber-q1-2025-earnings.html)", "score": 91, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1746621135.0, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1kgw6jx/uber_misses_revenue_expectations_with_trips_up_18/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kgw6jx/uber_misses_revenue_expectations_with_trips_up_18/", "subreddit": "stocks"}

{"id": "1j90y4t", "title": "2018 - same but different", "author": "pavelariel", "text": "Well hello there investors.\n\nI've been an active player in the financial markets since 2006, managing over 2b$ for the entirety of my licensed time and I have some thoughts to share with the world about what's happening these days, what the big players (in my undisclosed country) are doing and what retail investors are trying to do. Frankly, the title sells the point but I will use my black space here to fill in the small details.\n\nI will start with stating the obvious - the markets are extremely volatile! but that's o-k-a-y. Usually when the tides begin to rise, the weak will always crumble and the strong will keep on going. These days when the market begins a selloff with the current actual figures, I am peeking at the inflows/outflows of the grand ETFs and funds. Allow me to explain:\n\nMost of retail investors (maybe not you specifically but I am referring to 90% of actual retailers over here) are holding positions on the market through ETFs and Trust funds. During these perilious times, these investors are quick to jump the phone and tell their broker or. advisor (mua) to \"sell sell sell\". Those sell calls, when made, are driving the fund managers to dump their stocks and bonds thus creating an even larger negative wave which start another \"sell drive\" and so on. \n\nSo, basically, when I see such a large down-turn, I usually hold my horses, wait for the flow numbers of the large ETFs and funds to understand if the movement was driven by retailers with weak hands or is it an actual down-turn in the market driven by large investors/ money managers and so on. \n\nCurrently, I still don't hold the actual numbers but considering the past two days during which I had to talk to dozens of clients who all wanted a piece of their portfolio just \"out of the stock market\" I start to suspect that the former is the correct one.\n\nHaving stated that, I am looking at this correction with keen eyes to see a good entry point for many stocks which were just too damn high the past months. I do know that I might catch a so-called \"falling knife\" but considering the long-term, I just average-in the purchases over time and just let it work for a couple of years (depends on the investor of course).\n\nNow back to 2018 - do you remember what happened to the markets back then? Oh yeah. The same. The market dropped aroud 18% (Nasdaq dropped even more) and then flew back up. We can all state the obvious that the conomy is different and we are currently in an \"all time high\" and so on... but we were in the same \"all time high\" back then...\n\nWe can even say that the P/e is much higher, but then again the amount of money in the circulation is also much higher and more money = higher prices.\n\nAnyhow. Considering the long-term, these negative days are usually a good period to start considering stocks to purchase and that's my main point.\n\nHappy investing to us all ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1741725437.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1j90y4t/2018_same_but_different/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1j90y4t/2018_same_but_different/", "subreddit": "investment"}

{"id": "1gt6hyq", "title": "Gold and Silver at Two-Month Lows: A Golden Opportunity for Investors", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "In the realm of financial markets, there are moments that call for introspection—moments where volatility presents not just uncertainty but immense opportunity. Recent declines in gold and silver prices have thrust us into one of these moments. Gold futures have dipped to $2,558.50, while silver sits at $30.205, marking two-month lows. This price action, driven by a surging U.S. dollar, rising bond yields, and better risk appetite in equities, may seem disheartening at first glance. But look deeper, and you’ll find a scenario brimming with potential for the prudent investor.\n\nThis isn’t merely a dip in price—it’s a call to action, a chance to secure a position in two of the most historically resilient assets the financial world has ever known. Gold and silver are not relics of the past but living, breathing indicators of stability and value in a world where economic shifts can destabilize entire markets overnight.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtwzmr1dce1e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f586fca672705c0875f29fd4cc55942f19ac780\n\n# The Present Landscape: Signals of Transformation\n\nThe U.S. economy, while appearing stable on the surface, is revealing cracks that are difficult to ignore. October's Producer Price Index (PPI) rose by 0.2%, matching expectations but highlighting persistent underlying pressures. Similarly, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has ticked upward, adding fuel to the inflation narrative. Headlines warn of impending shocks for stock markets, which continue to exhibit a kind of cognitive dissonance regarding inflation’s long-term implications.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar index has climbed to a six-month high, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has hit 4.461%. While these factors have pressured precious metals in the short term, they are temporary conditions. The dollar’s strength and rising yields cannot indefinitely suppress the natural upward trajectory of gold and silver, especially as inflation concerns, geopolitical instability, and shifting monetary policies resurface with renewed vigor.\n\n# Why Physical Precious Metals?\n\nGold and silver offer something that no stock, bond, or digital asset can replicate: permanence. Their value isn’t tied to the whims of earnings reports, central bank decisions, or the speculative fervor of a bull market. Instead, they are grounded in physical reality, immune to the risks of counterparty defaults or technological disruptions.\n\nOwning physical precious metals allows investors to hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and market volatility. Unlike paper assets, which can lose value overnight due to external factors, physical gold and silver are tangible stores of wealth. They offer privacy, autonomy, and the kind of security that only real, physical assets can provide.\n\nGold, in particular, is not just a hedge; it’s a universal currency. Central banks around the world continue to accumulate it, signaling its enduring importance in global finance. Silver, often referred to as the “poor man’s gold,” has its own unique appeal. Its lower price point makes it accessible, while its industrial applications ensure a steady stream of demand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qf7hottobe1e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eef17d5b22371a01f720350ab7f71930f18b9a6\n\n# The Industrial Edge: Silver and Gold in Modern Technology\n\nBeyond their roles as monetary assets, gold and silver are critical components in modern industry. Silver, in particular, is indispensable in the transition to renewable energy. It’s a key material in solar panels, thanks to its unparalleled conductivity and reflectivity. Additionally, silver is used in batteries, medical technologies, water purification systems, and even electric vehicles.\n\nGold, while primarily viewed as a financial safe haven, also has significant industrial applications. Its resistance to corrosion and superior conductivity make it essential in electronics, aerospace technology, and medical devices. These industrial uses, combined with their traditional roles, make gold and silver uniquely positioned to thrive in both economic booms and busts.\n\nAs global industries continue to innovate, the demand for these metals will only grow. This industrial demand, coupled with their roles as safe-haven assets, creates a powerful dynamic that underpins their long-term value.\n\n[\\\\\"Sprott Money: Your go-to source for investment-grade bullion and exceptional service.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/caqy0bvrae1e1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398afded16f1d1ec405385a12cd464d4f6c297d4)\n\n# The Ripple Effect on Wider Markets\n\nThe influence of precious metals extends far beyond their own markets. They serve as a barometer for broader economic conditions, reflecting shifts in inflation, currency strength, and investor sentiment. When stock markets exhibit speculative excess, as they often do during periods of low volatility, gold and silver provide a counterbalance—a grounding force that reminds investors of the impermanence of paper wealth.\n\nIn bond markets, the story is similar. Rising yields may temporarily divert attention from precious metals, but history shows that such trends are cyclical. When yields peak and economic uncertainty reemerges, gold and silver often rally, attracting capital as investors seek stability.\n\nFor the broader economy, strong demand for gold and silver—whether for investment or industrial use—can signal shifts in economic priorities. Their prices often lead the way in highlighting underlying inflationary pressures or geopolitical risks that other markets are slower to recognize.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z18ffuece1e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e0cb2bc4b2447598a30b19ef6273af8021ab13\n\n# A Moment to Act\n\nThe current price decline is not a harbinger of doom but an opportunity for renewal. It is a moment to think critically about the nature of value, the fragility of modern financial systems, and the enduring strength of tangible assets. Investing in gold and silver is not simply a hedge against uncertainty; it’s an acknowledgment of the principles that underpin sound financial decision-making: resilience, permanence, and adaptability.\n\nThe road ahead may be uncertain, but history has shown us time and again that gold and silver endure. They rise when currencies falter, provide stability when markets waver, and offer refuge when chaos reigns. These metals are more than commodities; they are the anchors of civilization, the assets that stand firm amidst the ever-changing tides of human endeavor.\n\nFor those who act now, the rewards could be substantial. Gold and silver are not just investments; they are commitments to a philosophy of financial independence and security. The world may be unpredictable, but the value of these precious metals is not. Now is the time to embrace their strength and secure your future.\n\nThe markets may ebb and flow, but gold and silver remain eternal. And in this moment, as their prices beckon, the choice is clear: seize the opportunity, embrace the permanence, and let these timeless assets illuminate your path forward.", "score": 11, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1731820816.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gt6hyq/gold_and_silver_at_twomonth_lows_a_golden/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gt6hyq/gold_and_silver_at_twomonth_lows_a_golden/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1gqw0tt", "title": "AMD's Workforce Reduction: What It Means for Investors", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "AMD recently made headlines with its announcement that it would lay off 4% of its global workforce—roughly 1,000 employees—as part of its strategy to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company, which employed 26,000 people at the end of last year, is making bold moves to secure a foothold in a sector that has seen immense demand and exponential growth. However, AMD faces stiff competition from Nvidia, the undisputed leader in the AI chip space, and the company’s ability to catch up will be crucial for its future.\n\nFor investors, this move by AMD signals both potential risks and opportunities. The reduction in workforce comes at a time when AMD is pivoting its focus toward AI chips, hoping to capitalize on the $500 billion AI chip market expected by 2028. But with Nvidia holding more than 80% of the market share and continuing to dominate both the hardware and software sides of the AI sector, AMD has its work cut out. As investors, understanding these shifts and their potential impact on the market is vital for making informed decisions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjchrxf5gs0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bffce5dc65798e2fdbd65effc0fdba914b39316\n\n# AMD’s Strategic Shift Toward AI\n\nAMD’s decision to lay off employees is tied to a broader realignment of its resources toward its largest growth opportunity: AI. The company produces powerful AI accelerators like the MI300X, which are positioned as alternatives to Nvidia-based systems. Major players such as Meta and Microsoft have already adopted AMD’s offerings. However, AMD still has a long road ahead to compete with Nvidia, which has established an ecosystem that not only provides hardware but also the critical software tools that power AI applications, such as those behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nIn this context, AMD’s workforce reduction may be viewed as part of its effort to streamline operations and focus on its most promising areas, including AI. But the question remains—can AMD catch up to Nvidia’s lead in the AI market? While AMD’s stock has seen a 5% decline in 2024, Nvidia’s stock has skyrocketed by 200%, making it the most valuable company in the world. This stark contrast signals the depth of Nvidia’s dominance, leaving investors wondering if AMD can successfully execute its pivot to AI or if it will remain in Nvidia’s shadow.\n\nAMD’s move to focus on AI comes at a time when the company is struggling in other areas. The gaming market, which once represented a major revenue stream for AMD, is facing significant challenges. The company has projected a 59% decline in gaming revenue for 2024, which raises concerns about its ability to balance its various business segments as it shifts focus to AI. The question for investors is whether AMD can successfully navigate these challenges without sacrificing its position in other markets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16yd4ihrgs0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f68a6f35074bb79d741fc34aeba7230049c30b6a\n\n# The Market Dynamics: Nvidia’s Dominance vs. AMD’s Ambition\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges for AMD is Nvidia’s overwhelming dominance in the AI chip market. With more than 80% of the market share, Nvidia has established itself as the leader in this space, and its recent performance reflects this. The company’s stock surge has been fueled by its dominance in the AI sector, where it has built a comprehensive ecosystem of hardware and software that AI engineers rely on for developing programs and models.\n\nIn comparison, AMD’s AI chip sales, though significant at an expected $5 billion in 2024, represent just a fraction of the total market size. Despite its best efforts, AMD’s revenue in the AI space is dwarfed by Nvidia’s anticipated $125.9 billion in 2024, leaving AMD with a steep hill to climb. Moreover, AMD is up against not only Nvidia’s hardware dominance but also its software ecosystem, which plays a crucial role in the AI development process. AMD has yet to build a comparable software infrastructure, which is a critical barrier to its success.\n\nHowever, this shift toward AI does present significant opportunities for AMD. The global demand for AI chips is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years, and companies like Meta and Microsoft are already showing interest in AMD’s alternatives to Nvidia’s offerings. While Nvidia may hold the upper hand for now, there is still room for AMD to capture a larger share of this expanding market if it can overcome the challenges and build out the necessary ecosystem around its products. The AI chip market is expected to reach $500 billion by 2028, and as this market matures, AMD’s efforts could pay off significantly if it can successfully compete with Nvidia.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the power of precision mining with Kuya Silver, setting new standards in the silver industry.\\\\\" \\(CSE: KUYA | OTCQB: KUYAF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/eyw9ngrdgs0e1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3c9e99667284c2c3b0811dc4b27fc93ed6bd179)\n\n# Implications for Investors\n\nFor investors, AMD’s pivot toward AI and its workforce reduction could have mixed implications. In the short term, the layoff announcement and the company’s underperformance in gaming may raise concerns. Workforce reductions often signal restructuring, and they can sometimes be indicative of a company struggling to meet its growth expectations. Combined with the fact that AMD’s stock has declined by 5% in 2024, while Nvidia’s stock has soared, there’s a real risk that AMD may continue to underperform in the short term.\n\nHowever, for those willing to look at the bigger picture, AMD’s focus on AI presents a significant opportunity. The AI market is expected to grow rapidly, and as AMD invests in this sector, it could capture a larger portion of this lucrative market in the coming years. Investors who are patient and willing to take on some risk might find long-term potential in AMD, especially if the company can manage to narrow the gap with Nvidia and establish a stronger presence in AI.\n\nAMD’s ongoing efforts to expand its market share in AI and server processors will also play a crucial role in its future growth. The company has made notable gains in server CPU sales, but it is still a distant competitor to Intel. AMD’s success in both AI and processor markets will depend on its ability to execute its strategy effectively and build a competitive edge.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3b2jc1yfgs0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75fe05f7226937f2955fe5dd0733c68af417531c\n\n# AMD's AI Shift: Risks and Long-Term Rewards\n\nAMD’s recent workforce reduction and its strategic shift toward AI chip production represent a critical inflection point for the company. While the decision may have negative short-term consequences for its stock price, the long-term potential of AI offers a major growth opportunity. However, the company faces significant challenges, including Nvidia’s market dominance and the need to build a competitive software ecosystem.\n\nFor investors, the key to understanding AMD’s future lies in its ability to execute its strategy and capitalize on the rapidly growing AI market. While Nvidia remains the dominant player in the AI space, AMD’s commitment to this market and its focus on long-term growth could offer substantial rewards. However, investors must weigh the risks carefully, especially in the short term, as AMD navigates a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The next few years will be crucial for AMD, and its ability to adapt will determine its success in the AI chip market.\n\n  \nIf You Enjoyed This Article, [Check Out This One From The Silver Academy!](https://thesilverindustry.substack.com/p/bitcoins-fragile-future-unmasking)", "score": 7, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1731555946.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gqw0tt/amds_workforce_reduction_what_it_means_for/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gqw0tt/amds_workforce_reduction_what_it_means_for/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1gpz8xb", "title": "Polish Energy Corporation 'Orlen' Secures EIB Financing to Prepare Poland's Grid for Renewable Energy", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Polish energy giant Orlen, with support from the European Investment Bank (EIB), has taken a major step in preparing Poland's power grid for the future of green energy. The EIB is extending PLN 900 million (roughly $221 million) to Orlen to help modernize the electricity distribution network in northern and central Poland. This financing marks the first installment of a broader PLN 3.5 billion commitment from the EIB, under the REPowerEU initiative, aimed at diversifying the energy mix and accelerating Europe’s green transition.\n\nThis ambitious upgrade to Poland’s grid is more than a technical enhancement; it’s a crucial development for investors in the energy sector and a promising sign for the broader renewable energy market. Here’s what this means for the energy market, investors, and the role of precious metals in the green energy landscape.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4jzc45d5k0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e24ad6540f49df5dfa711494b35c9d009907b2f\n\n# Transforming the Polish Grid: A Win for Renewables\n\nWith support from the EIB, Orlen’s unit, Energa, will modernize infrastructure to connect more renewable energy sources to the grid. By doing so, Orlen is paving the way for a significant increase in renewable energy capacity in Poland. Already, Energa’s network has a renewable energy capacity of 9.2 GW, and in just the first nine months of this year, it connected nearly 21,500 renewable installations, including small-scale prosumer setups, adding another 801 MW to the grid.\n\nAs more renewable installations come online, Energa’s upgraded grid will be critical in managing the complexities of distributed generation, energy storage, and demand-supply balancing. For the energy market, this development reinforces Europe’s commitment to green energy and signals Poland’s growing role in the continent’s green energy infrastructure.\n\n# What This Means for Investors\n\nFor investors in the energy sector, Orlen’s financing from the EIB is a clear signal that the energy landscape is changing—and fast. Fossil fuel investments are facing growing pressure due to regulatory changes and market sentiment shifting toward sustainability. Meanwhile, investments in renewable energy infrastructure, like Orlen's grid upgrades, present a compelling alternative with long-term growth potential.\n\nHere’s why investors should pay attention:\n\n1. **Increased Stability in Renewable Energy**: With a modernized grid, Poland can more reliably integrate wind, solar, and other renewable sources. For investors, this means greater stability and predictability in energy supply from renewables—a factor that has historically been a barrier to green energy investments.\n2. **Potential for High Returns**: Green energy is no longer just an environmental imperative; it’s a booming investment sector. The EIB’s commitment to fund such projects underlines the high growth potential in renewable energy infrastructure. By financing Orlen, the EIB is essentially lowering the financial risk for investors, creating a more attractive investment climate in renewables.\n3. **A Diversified Energy Market**: Europe’s REPowerEU program aims to diversify energy sources, making countries less dependent on single sources like fossil fuels. This move to diversify enhances energy security and positions Poland—and investors within it—as less vulnerable to energy market fluctuations that have historically affected fossil fuel investments.\n\nAs fossil fuel investments become less predictable, green energy projects, especially those backed by solid financing agreements like Orlen’s, offer a forward-thinking alternative with a promising long-term outlook. Investors interested in sustainable growth should seriously consider the renewable energy sector as an increasingly viable—and profitable—option.\n\n# Precious Metals: An Essential Part of Renewable Energy’s Growth\n\nWhen we talk about the future of renewable energy, we can’t overlook the role of precious metals. Precious metals like silver, platinum, and palladium are critical components in renewable technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced battery storage systems.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imnph2ej4k0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d5fc79f38244bd44928d9d73cf026189ddbdd35\n\n# The Role of Precious Metals in Solar Energy\n\nSilver is essential for solar panel manufacturing due to its high conductivity. The metal is used in the photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity. As solar installations continue to rise globally, demand for silver in the energy sector is expected to follow suit. For investors in precious metals, this growth in solar energy represents a new and expanding demand stream, adding a unique layer of value to an already valuable asset.\n\n# Platinum’s Role in Hydrogen and Battery Technology\n\nPlatinum is a key material in hydrogen fuel cells, which are being developed as an alternative to traditional batteries. As battery storage becomes crucial to grid stability (enabling energy storage from intermittent sources like wind and solar), platinum and other metals will see increased demand. This convergence of renewable energy technology and precious metals represents a diversified investment opportunity for those interested in both sectors.\n\n[\\\\\"West Red Lake Gold Mines: Pioneering the future of gold exploration in Ontario's prolific Red Lake District.\\\\\" \\(TSXV: WRLG | OTCQB: WRLGF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ekqxm6nk4k0e1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7edf262a3883b1116ce7edc9758357cd31650296)\n\n# Optimistic Outlook for Renewable Energy and the Role of Policy\n\nOrlen’s project and the EIB’s financing commitment provide an optimistic look at renewable energy’s potential, but it’s not just about market forces—government policy plays a pivotal role. With programs like REPowerEU, European leaders are recognizing the importance of sustainable energy infrastructure and creating favorable conditions for it to flourish.\n\nAs more countries adopt similar policies, we’re likely to see an acceleration in green energy adoption and related infrastructure upgrades, further boosting investor confidence. With a supportive policy framework, Europe—and Poland in particular—are setting themselves up for a successful green energy transition.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnds2a3g5k0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a2e92bf0752f0f53f56ca7984543689956276db\n\n# A New Era for the Energy Market\n\nOrlen’s financing deal with the EIB is more than a step toward upgrading Poland’s energy grid—it’s a significant move toward a greener, more sustainable, and more profitable energy market. For investors, this development highlights the shifting landscape of energy, where renewables are becoming not just viable but increasingly attractive compared to traditional energy sources.\n\nAs renewable energy technologies advance and integrate further with our energy systems, the demand for precious metals will also rise, presenting a unique opportunity for those invested in the metals market. The convergence of energy and materials markets signifies a new era for diversified investments in green technologies, making now a compelling time for investors to consider opportunities within renewable energy.\n\nThe future is bright for renewables, and with continued financial support, favorable policies, and technological progress, we may soon see a transformed energy market that rewards both the planet and investors.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1731455422.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gpz8xb/polish_energy_corporation_orlen_secures_eib/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gpz8xb/polish_energy_corporation_orlen_secures_eib/", "subreddit": "investment"}

It signals a long-term shift in Detroit’s fortunes, fueled by the accelerating growth of electric vehicles. For investors, this moment offers a clear message: Detroit’s best days are ahead of it. As GM solidifies its position at the forefront of the EV market, it also opens up new opportunities in industries like precious metals, which are becoming increasingly critical in the production of these advanced vehicles.\n\n[GM World Headquarters - Detroit, Michigan ](https://preview.redd.it/a9hgi4up5d0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83d84179dbde4863b4bf3215385a5b8f58a916bd)\n\n# Detroit’s Automotive Renaissance\n\nFor years, Detroit was perceived as a relic of the past—a city and industry struggling to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements shaping the global automotive market. But as GM’s stock price soars in 2024, it’s clear that the Motor City is undergoing a profound transformation.\n\nGM’s 54.7% stock price increase isn’t just a fluke. The automaker’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and EVs has positioned it as a leader in the automotive sector. While competitors like Ford and Tesla struggle, GM is not only holding its ground but is outperforming the market, defying the cyclical nature that has historically held back legacy automakers.\n\nUnder the leadership of Mary Barra, GM has proven it’s capable of adapting to the new realities of the automotive world, with the company’s investments in electric vehicle technology, autonomous driving, and battery systems paying dividends. Barra’s vision for GM’s future as an EV powerhouse is becoming a reality, and as Detroit pivots toward greener, more sustainable technologies, the city itself is on the brink of a new economic renaissance.\n\nThis resurgence isn’t confined to GM. The broader Detroit ecosystem is benefitting from the ripple effects of GM’s success, as suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers all align themselves with the EV future. GM’s transformation is catalyzing a resurgence for the entire region, breathing new life into the economy and positioning Detroit as a critical player in the global automotive market.\n\n# GM vs. Competitors: A Shift in the EV Landscape\n\nWhile GM’s success in 2024 is noteworthy, it’s essential to consider how the automaker is faring compared to its competitors, especially Tesla. GM’s 54.7% stock price increase is impressive, especially when juxtaposed with Tesla’s growth of 29.3% and Ford’s 10% decline. While Tesla remains a dominant force in the EV sector, it faces challenges in maintaining its high valuation amid growing competition.\n\nTesla’s stock price has surged following political developments, like President-elect Donald Trump’s win, but its long-term growth prospects are clouded by increasing competition. Companies like GM are closing the gap with Tesla, offering more affordable EV models, diversifying their vehicle portfolios, and building out a robust infrastructure to support electric mobility. GM’s success in 2024 underscores its ability to challenge Tesla’s dominance and could signal the beginning of a more competitive EV market.\n\nIn contrast, Ford’s struggles this year illustrate the cyclical nature of the automotive industry, where even established players must adapt or fall behind. Ford’s 10% decline in stock price highlights its inability to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the EV market. Meanwhile, GM’s consistent performance and ability to outperform Wall Street expectations underscore its operational agility and its commitment to leading the charge in electric mobility.\n\nFor investors, the rise of GM and the struggles of competitors like Ford and Tesla offer valuable insights into the direction of the EV market. GM’s focus on traditional strengths like operational efficiency, combined with its aggressive push into the electric vehicle space, makes it a strong contender in the global EV race.\n\n[Precious Metals!](https://preview.redd.it/5qwhomu87d0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee982f3778fb43496343ac155408bee3d71a83d)\n\n# Precious Metals and the EV Revolution\n\nOne of the most important—and often overlooked—factors driving GM’s success in the EV market is its use of precious metals. As GM, and the automotive industry at large, moves further into electric vehicles, the demand for metals like silver, platinum, and palladium is set to rise dramatically.\n\nSilver, for instance, is an essential component in EV manufacturing due to its unmatched conductivity. It is used extensively in electric vehicle motors, batteries, and in the overall electrical systems that power these vehicles. As GM ramps up production of electric cars, the demand for silver will increase, creating a growing market for investors in the precious metals space.\n\nPlatinum and palladium, typically associated with gasoline-powered vehicles, are also critical for the growing number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which GM and other automakers are actively pursuing as an alternative to battery-electric vehicles. Platinum is used in the fuel cells themselves, while palladium is integral to the catalytic converters used in vehicle emissions systems. With the rise of both electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, these metals are experiencing an uptick in demand, further bolstering the precious metals market.\n\nFor investors, this presents an incredible opportunity. As GM pushes ahead with its EV ambitions, the demand for these precious metals is only going to increase. Investors who recognize this trend early will be in a prime position to benefit from the upward price movements of silver, platinum, and palladium as automakers like GM and others ramp up production to meet the world’s growing demand for sustainable transportation.\n\n[\\\\\"Aya Gold &amp; Silver: Pioneering the path to prosperity through world-class mining operations. \\(TSX: AYA | OTCQX: AYASF\\)\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/li45kfa46d0e1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4764264ade1d18e97024c72b27b17a77fab784de)\n\n# What This Means for Investors and the EV Market\n\nThe rise of GM, Detroit’s automotive revival, and the growing demand for precious metals intersect to create a unique opportunity for investors. GM’s dominance in the EV market signals a long-term shift in the global automotive industry, and as automakers increasingly rely on silver, platinum, and palladium, the precious metals market is set to benefit.\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on this transition can do so by focusing on GM’s future growth prospects, but they should also consider the growing importance of precious metals in the automotive supply chain. Whether you’re investing directly in GM or in the commodities market, the rise of electric vehicles is set to drive up demand for these metals. As electric vehicles become mainstream, automakers will be forced to source more of these essential materials, creating a tight market for investors to navigate.\n\nThe economic implications of this shift are vast. Detroit’s revitalization means more jobs, more economic growth, and more opportunities for businesses in the region. But it also means that the supply and demand dynamics of precious metals are changing. As automakers like GM continue to push the envelope with new technologies, the need for materials like silver, platinum, and palladium will grow exponentially. Investors who understand this shift will be well-positioned to capitalize on both the automotive renaissance and the surge in demand for critical metals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dyh725y7d0e1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d1eb83e02f1f4698858c81f83fe6e90395e79aa\n\n# A Bright Future for Detroit and Investors\n\nIn short, GM’s Wall Street triumph is more than just a story about stock prices—it’s a signal of the broader economic transformation happening in Detroit and the automotive industry at large. GM’s success is a testament to Detroit’s ability to innovate and adapt in the face of change, and it’s opening new doors for investors to explore.\n\nAs the demand for electric vehicles skyrockets, the demand for precious metals like silver, platinum, and palladium will follow suit. This offers investors an opportunity to profit not just from the growth of GM, but from the increasing value of these metals. As Detroit continues to lead the charge in the EV revolution, both the city and its investors are poised for an exciting future. The best may be yet to come for GM, Detroit, and the broader automotive industry.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you may also enjoy this article from: [The Silver Academy ](https://thesilverindustry.substack.com/p/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-community)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1731371438.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gp7xtw/gms_wall_street_vindication_a_bright_future_for/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gp7xtw/gms_wall_street_vindication_a_bright_future_for/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1gnm539", "title": "Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Market Cap as Stock Rallies After Trump Win: Questioning the Elon Musk Phenomenon", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Tesla’s stock recently surged past $1 trillion in market cap, a milestone few companies achieve. However, this ascent comes not only from investor faith in the electric vehicle industry, but also from Elon Musk’s ability to sway public opinion and wield political influence. This phenomenon calls for a closer look, not just at Tesla’s success, but at Musk himself—a man whose actions and approach raise serious questions about ethics, transparency, and accountability.\n\nAs the market rally follows Donald Trump’s recent election victory, Musk’s personal and political alliances deserve scrutiny. Musk, who was one of Trump’s most prominent financial supporters, contributed over $130 million to Trump’s campaign efforts. It’s not just Musk’s monetary support that has people talking, but the influence he stands to wield in a potentially favorable political landscape. This raises the question: to what extent are Musk’s ambitions driving Tesla’s stock, and to what end?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2b3rgy6yfyzd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f966a3fc1bbaf91c287877f85da9d6c4d42716de\n\n# Musk’s Close Ties with Trump: A Question of Principles\n\nElon Musk’s alignment with Trump may reflect a troubling willingness to prioritize personal gain over ethical boundaries. For someone who frequently touts his concern for humanity’s future—from his ventures in clean energy to ambitious space exploration—Musk’s choice to back a polarizing figure like Trump is at odds with the humanitarian image he projects. It raises questions about the authenticity of Musk’s moral compass. Is Musk truly committed to bettering the world, or is he simply using his influence to secure the most profitable path for himself and his companies?\n\nThe tech mogul’s significant political investment in Trump has stirred speculation among investors that a less-regulated environment could play to Tesla’s advantage, particularly if subsidies are eliminated. A Trump administration may, indeed, cut the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which has been pivotal to driving Tesla’s sales. But while Musk may publicly embrace this challenge, in reality, he’s made little secret of his desire for Tesla to operate free from restrictions, even when these restrictions serve the public good. Musk’s vision appears rooted in a single, unchecked philosophy: profit at all costs.\n\n# The Monopoly Play: Using Tariffs to Push Out Competition\n\nWith Musk’s influence over the White House, he may also benefit from increased tariffs on Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio. Higher tariffs could protect Tesla from foreign competitors in the U.S. market, but they would also represent a calculated attempt to eliminate competition rather than out-innovate it. It’s a strategy that diverges sharply from Musk’s self-styled image as a technological pioneer focused on creating a level playing field through sustainable innovation.\n\nBy lobbying for tariff protections while enjoying the perks of political access, Musk is positioning Tesla not as a champion of free market principles but as a corporate behemoth eager to use influence to cement its position. Investors betting on Tesla should consider the implications of this approach, as it presents a world where Tesla’s success depends not just on innovation, but on Musk’s ability to manipulate political landscapes for personal gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2g7tc4xffyzd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8b2665c01e85cce47246691ebd11875e0b32174\n\n# Musk’s Ambitions for Autonomous Vehicles: A Concerning Overreach\n\nMusk has been vocal about Tesla’s aspirations to lead in the autonomous driving space, yet the company lags behind Waymo, which has operational robotaxi services in major U.S. cities. Musk’s ambition to control a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles” represents an attempt to shift regulatory control in Tesla’s favor. Currently, approvals for autonomous driving are managed at the state level, creating a complex yet necessary system of checks and balances that ensure public safety.\n\nBy seeking a centralized federal system, Musk not only reveals his desire to bypass state regulations but also his disregard for the intricate ethical concerns that come with autonomy. Autonomous driving technology, unlike any other, requires more than technical readiness; it demands ethical responsibility and a commitment to public safety. Musk’s proposal for federal oversight could allow Tesla to push autonomous vehicles into public spaces more quickly, but at what cost? Musk’s history of overpromising and underdelivering on timelines suggests that his ambition might come before the welfare of Tesla’s customers and society at large.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the power of precision mining with Kuya Silver, setting new standards in the silver industry.\\\\\" \\(CSE: KUYA | OTCQB: KUYAF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/51x0oencfyzd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33d4693cb7bba3816b75a320eb1ea2f4d51819eb)\n\n# A Financial Powerhouse Built on Unquestioned Public Perception\n\nTesla’s earnings report—$25.18 billion in revenue and $2.17 billion in net income for the third quarter—demonstrates the company’s strong financial position. But what drives Tesla’s market value is not simply its earnings; it’s the larger-than-life image Musk has cultivated around himself. The trillion-dollar valuation is, in part, a public endorsement of Musk’s promises about the future, not only for electric vehicles but for humanity. However, this valuation rests on Musk’s ability to maintain public faith in his vision—faith that could easily erode should his promises fail to materialize.\n\nMusk’s confidence in Tesla’s growth targets—20-30% for 2024—is compelling, but how grounded are these projections? Musk has frequently touted ambitious goals, yet his track record suggests a pattern of optimism that borders on misrepresentation. His tendency to make lofty predictions that Tesla struggles to fulfill calls into question the ethical boundaries of his leadership style. Investors should be wary of Musk’s claims, as they may be grounded less in practicality and more in his desire to maintain the myth of boundless growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0wwsatnfyzd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844a64c9dae821e8356f8c410b99d80111abb751\n\n# A Cautionary Tale of Influence and Power\n\nTesla’s valuation isn’t just a figure; it’s a product of Musk’s unique influence over a segment of the public that sees him as a visionary. However, that influence comes with profound risks, not only for Tesla’s future but for society. A billionaire who uses his wealth and status to shape political policy risks becoming an entity far larger than any company—a person who operates outside traditional limits on corporate and political power.\n\nMusk’s alignment with Trump, his push for reduced competition, and his drive for federalized oversight in the autonomous driving space all reflect a person whose ambition threatens to blur the lines between public good and private gain. As Tesla rides this wave of optimism, investors and the public alike must grapple with the question: are we enabling the rise of a new breed of corporate titan, one who bends ethics and regulations to suit his own goals?\n\nTesla’s valuation in the wake of Trump’s election is not just a sign of market success; it’s a moment that calls for deep reflection on the costs of unchecked ambition. Investors may find reward in the short term, but in the long term, the Tesla-Musk phenomenon challenges us to consider the ethical implications of power, influence, and corporate responsibility. As we marvel at Tesla’s achievements, we must remain vigilant, questioning not just Musk’s methods but the wisdom of placing blind faith in any individual, regardless of their charisma or promises.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1731192444.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gnm539/tesla_hits_1_trillion_market_cap_as_stock_rallies/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gnm539/tesla_hits_1_trillion_market_cap_as_stock_rallies/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1gkonee", "title": "Election Speculation Drives Stock Futures Higher: Implications for Investors and the Broader Market", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "On Tuesday night, as election results started to roll in, stock futures surged, spurred by speculation that former President Donald Trump might hold an edge in the presidential race. Dow futures jumped 490 points, or roughly 1.2%, while S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 0.9%. These movements highlight investor optimism in the face of potential shifts in political leadership. Additionally, small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2000 futures, climbed more than 2%, underscoring the market’s broader response to a potential Trump victory.\n\nAs the nation watches the close race unfold between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, investors are carefully considering the possible outcomes. NBC News has projected that Trump and Harris are securing victories in states where they are expected to perform well. However, the key swing state of Georgia remains undecided, adding suspense to the trajectory of these markets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8e8s7cb47zd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d34e290711b7636e90f3604d46f44cc8728ce0\n\n# What This Means for Investors\n\nA Trump win could have a substantial impact on the stock market and, by extension, investor portfolios. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that a Trump win, coupled with a Republican sweep in Congress, could lead to a 3% boost in the S&amp;P 500, while a Trump win with a divided Congress would likely prompt a 1.5% gain. In contrast, a Harris victory with a divided Congress could cause a 1.5% drop in the S&amp;P 500, reflecting a more restrained market response. For investors, these predictions suggest that market sentiment leans toward preferring a Trump-led administration when it comes to potential market growth, particularly for equities.\n\nJason Trennert, chairman of Strategas, expressed a clear view on the potential outcomes, stating, “I very much ascribe to that view that a Trump victory would be very good for stocks.” He noted that a Harris win might not bode as well for risk assets, which are typically more volatile and yield higher returns. Investors keen on high-growth potential assets, therefore, might find more confidence in a Trump-led government, where risk assets are likely to receive favorable treatment.\n\nTrump’s agenda of tax cuts and corporate incentives could indeed be a boon for American businesses, strengthening market appeal and boosting stock values. However, his approach could also introduce global uncertainties, including the possibility of steeper tariffs and the potential for trade conflicts, which could, in turn, reignite inflationary pressures. Investors with a global outlook should weigh these risks carefully, as a resurgence in tariffs could affect sectors reliant on international trade, impacting returns on investments tied to global supply chains.\n\n# The Market Impact of Regulatory Differences\n\nA Harris administration would present a distinct regulatory approach, especially in sectors like healthcare, financial services, and energy. Harris and the Democrats’ inclination toward stricter regulations in the banking and healthcare industries could introduce more oversight and potentially slow growth in these sectors. Investors in these fields may need to recalibrate their strategies, considering that increased regulatory scrutiny could restrict profit margins and hamper expansion plans.\n\nConversely, Harris’s pro-clean energy stance aligns with long-term shifts toward sustainable investments. In particular, electric vehicle companies and solar firms stand to benefit from Democratic-led clean energy policies, presenting investment opportunities for those interested in the renewable energy sector. This administration’s policies could also encourage further research and innovation in green technologies, possibly opening up new investment avenues in a sector that continues to grow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t75u74kw47zd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d8b3eb77ba6b4b72a9f9b91743d7f75d2bc318\n\n# The Influence of Congress’s Partisan Makeup\n\nThe congressional makeup also plays a critical role in shaping the economic environment investors must navigate. If Republicans secure both chambers, investors may anticipate more drastic tax cuts and corporate-friendly policies, creating a robust environment for growth-driven assets. Conversely, if Democrats maintain or expand their control, spending on social programs and renewable energy initiatives could rise, influencing sectors like healthcare and clean energy.\n\nA divided Congress, however, might moderate the legislative changes in either direction, creating a more stable backdrop for investors. This balance could mitigate market volatility, as no single party would be able to push through extreme policy changes unilaterally. For investors, a divided Congress may offer a certain predictability, appealing to those seeking consistent returns with lower volatility.\n\n[\\\\\"Explore the rich legacy of silver mining with Dolly Varden Silver, where history meets modern innovation.\\\\\" \\(TSX.V:DV | OTCQX:DOLLF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9ppj4ujm37zd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f7761ad834c1b4828dca6c83d26ae569fa4551a)\n\n# Current Market Sentiment and Outlook\n\nIn anticipation of the election results, the market staged a notable rally, with the S&amp;P 500 climbing 1.2% by Tuesday evening, bringing its 2024 gains to over 21%. This rally illustrates that the market, as a whole, is primed for positive momentum, fueled by potential outcomes that could benefit key sectors of the economy. Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar, both of which are expected to rise in a Trump victory, also saw gains, signaling optimism from multiple asset classes.\n\nThe rising optimism across the market suggests that investors are betting on a favorable outcome that aligns with their broader expectations of lower corporate taxes and market-friendly policies. However, it is essential for investors to recognize that while immediate gains are promising, the political landscape will continue to bring both challenges and opportunities. As always, a strategic approach that considers both the short-term market euphoria and the long-term implications of policy changes will serve investors best.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15lf9w6o37zd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7301000f3d1b34d56b94ceae3bb7263645c6be70\n\n# Investors Await Market Shifts Post-Election Results\n\nAs election results continue to roll in, the market’s trajectory is poised for profound shifts, shaping both domestic and international investment landscapes. Right now, a potential Trump victory could signal growth for risk assets, with reduced corporate tax burdens attracting investors aiming for high returns.

{"id": "1giep8e", "title": "Petrobras’ Ambitious Investment Plan: A New Era for Investors and the Global Market", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Brazil’s Petrobras is setting its sights high, with plans to increase its investment to $110 billion between 2025 and 2029. This represents an 8% increase over prior projections, driven by ambitions to expand oil and gas exploration, stabilize production, and secure a future of diversified growth. For investors, this is a monumental shift, laden with both opportunity and risk. Here’s a closer look at what this means for Petrobras, the larger oil and gas sector, and for investors seeking to navigate an evolving energy landscape.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzff8que2myd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa3b173e40878bc0bbbf9401ddff2d66cebf86e\n\n# Petrobras’ Strategy: Investment, Resilience, and Adaptation\n\nPetrobras’ strategic pivot to ramp up investments is indicative of a shift in focus toward reinforcing its foundational assets while exploring new opportunities. Following years of divesting assets outside Brazil, the company now looks inward, aiming to strengthen domestic production and ensure the stability of its core oil fields. This includes prioritizing resource replacement, developing new oil and gas frontiers, and increasing supply capabilities, which are crucial for Brazil’s economy and energy security.\n\nCEO Magda Chambriard has expressed particular concern over the depletion of Petrobras' existing fields, notably those in the Campos Basin, which have been showing signs of aging. These mature fields remain central to Petrobras’ strategy, and reversing their decline is vital not only for the company’s stability but also for maintaining its production targets. To address this, Petrobras plans to maximize output from these fields while adding production capacity through new floating production and storage vessels.\n\nSuch a robust investment in exploration and production is a powerful signal of Petrobras’ commitment to stability and growth, which resonates beyond the company to the broader energy market. By setting ambitious spending targets, Petrobras underscores the significance of Latin America as a key player in global energy, potentially influencing global supply and, in turn, affecting prices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5q1859i2myd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=657cf81d9e937202b50ba2618f776e4eaa098fe5\n\n# Impact on Investors: Opportunity Amid Complexity\n\nFor investors, Petrobras’ investment plans present both compelling opportunities and complex challenges. An 8% increase in investment to $110 billion is not a decision taken lightly, and it speaks volumes about the company's long-term commitment to profitability and market resilience.\n\n# The Pros: Stronger Market Position and Profit Potential\n\nFrom an investment perspective, Petrobras’ increased spending could mean greater returns in the long run. By focusing on stabilizing and expanding domestic production, Petrobras positions itself as a formidable entity in the global oil market. This move can attract investors who value companies with a strong, stable market position and the ambition to expand their reserves and production capacity.\n\nMoreover, the company’s strategy of focusing on highly profitable assets and leveraging its existing infrastructure is an appealing aspect for shareholders. Petrobras is not attempting to chase every opportunity; rather, it’s focusing on maximizing returns on well-defined, profitable assets. This careful focus on profitability and domestic growth can build investor confidence, suggesting that Petrobras is not only committed to growth but is doing so in a controlled, sustainable manner.\n\n# The Cons: High Risk, Volatility, and Uncertainty\n\nHowever, with opportunity comes significant risk. A $110 billion investment plan over five years is a huge commitment, and one that comes with considerable challenges. The oil and gas industry is notoriously volatile, subject to geopolitical tensions, environmental concerns, and the ongoing global energy transition. For investors, this level of capital outlay raises questions about the potential for return and whether Petrobras can weather potential disruptions.\n\nAdditionally, focusing primarily on mature fields, even with plans to reverse declines, is not without risk. The maintenance and enhancement of aging fields are costly and labor-intensive, and there’s no guarantee of success. If efforts to revitalize these fields fall short, Petrobras could face steep production declines and disappointing returns on its investments, affecting its stock performance and, ultimately, its investors.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the convenience of free shipping on your precious metals purchases with Sprott Money.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/bfghi3y72myd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ff62d1ddbf1a7ac65a4d3074bdbf52b663f2af4)\n\n# Market Implications: How Petrobras’ Strategy Shapes the Industry\n\nThe larger implications of Petrobras’ investment are substantial, potentially impacting not only Latin America’s energy landscape but also global oil dynamics. For one, this level of investment in Brazil’s energy sector could serve as a stabilizing factor for the region, reinforcing its role as a major supplier of oil and gas to the global market. In a world where energy security is a constant concern, this focus on domestic production and reserve replacement may strengthen Brazil’s position and potentially insulate Petrobras from some international market shocks.\n\nMoreover, with new production capabilities, Petrobras is poised to make an impact on global oil supply, which could, in turn, influence oil prices. Increased production from Petrobras may help temper the price volatility in global markets, potentially providing a measure of stability for consumers. However, the risk of environmental opposition and regulatory changes remains ever-present, as governments and activists increasingly push for cleaner energy alternatives. If Petrobras faces significant opposition to its exploration and production initiatives, it may encounter costly delays and increased regulatory pressure, impacting both profitability and share value.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnd7drxa2myd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18b86523848f9b86f92a7bbb3046af3108a72342\n\n# A Balanced Path Forward for Investors\n\nFor investors considering Petrobras, the company’s expanded investment plan presents a mixed bag of promise and peril. On the one hand, Petrobras is firmly planting itself as a leader in Latin America’s oil industry, demonstrating a commitment to stability, growth, and profitability. The focus on profitable assets and diversified growth offers a compelling narrative for those looking for stable, long-term returns.\n\nYet, the inherent risks of the oil and gas sector—geopolitical volatility, environmental concerns, and the challenges of maintaining aging fields—should not be underestimated. Investors need to weigh these factors carefully, considering not only the potential for profit but also the high level of commitment required in a sector as turbulent as energy.\n\nPetrobras’ path forward is ambitious, and while it comes with challenges, it also represents a substantial opportunity for investors with an appetite for risk and an eye on long-term returns.

{"id": "1gg1rhb", "title": "Meta's Reality Labs: The $4.4 Billion Question for Investors", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Meta's Reality Labs division recently reported an operating loss of $4.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Despite this, the division managed a 29% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, reaching $270 million—falling short of analysts’ expectations of $310.4 million. These mixed results demand investors' attention. The enormous financial outlay, coupled with gradual revenue growth, poses a critical question: is Meta's investment in AR and VR technology a bold, visionary move or a financial misstep?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olvcas6xjzxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbec0e6f335a47f4a8f40be0d1325d9f8a1839a5\n\n# The Vision Behind Reality Labs\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, has maintained a firm belief in the transformative potential of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). He envisions these technologies as the next pivotal step in personal computing—an evolution that could redefine how people interact, communicate, and experience digital content. This ambitious vision has come at a steep cost: Reality Labs has accumulated losses exceeding $58 billion since 2020.\n\nBut why is this investment so significant? Meta’s approach resembles the strategic moves of earlier tech giants who absorbed heavy initial losses to secure leadership positions in emerging industries. Consider Amazon's early years, when the company sacrificed profitability to dominate e-commerce, or Tesla’s relentless push to establish itself as the leader in electric vehicles. For Zuckerberg and Meta, AR and VR represent not just new technologies but a foundational shift in human-computer interaction.\n\n# The Risk-Reward Dilemma for Investors\n\nFrom an investor’s standpoint, the situation at Meta’s Reality Labs can be both unsettling and enticing. Historically, companies that have redefined markets often faced skepticism and periods of financial strain. Amazon and Tesla are pertinent examples—companies that were criticized for their inability to turn immediate profits while they were, in fact, laying the groundwork for future dominance.\n\nThe key difference here is that Meta isn’t just refining a product; it is attempting to define a new platform. The metaverse is more than an add-on to existing technologies—it’s an entirely new way to engage with the digital world. For investors, this presents a dilemma: do you have the stomach to endure short-term pain for the promise of long-term gain?\n\nThe Reality Labs loss of $4.4 billion isn’t a small hiccup. This kind of expenditure and loss affects investor sentiment and market psychology. Analysts had initially projected even greater losses for the quarter ($4.68 billion), which suggests Meta might be managing its costs slightly better than anticipated. Yet, a nearly $60 billion cumulative loss since 2020 demands critical analysis. Is this calculated risk worth the potential reward?\n\n# Meta’s Strategy: Seeking a Critical Mass\n\nMeta's strategy involves creating a compelling narrative around its upcoming products to drive developer interest and consumer adoption. In September 2024, Meta showcased its Orion AR glasses prototype at the company’s annual Connect conference. This demonstration was crucial, as Orion could be the key to solidifying Meta's leadership in the AR space. Additionally, Meta hopes to build on the unexpected popularity of its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, developed with EssilorLuxottica, and plans to promote the Orion AR glasses to consumers in the near future.\n\nMeta has also introduced the Quest 3S VR headset, priced competitively at $299 to broaden its appeal. By doing so, Meta aims to increase the accessibility of VR to consumers and strengthen its market presence. However, the strategy isn’t solely about selling devices; it’s about cultivating an ecosystem of developers willing to create engaging and useful applications for these AR and VR platforms.\n\nThe risks, however, are substantial. AR and VR technology adoption is still nascent, and while Meta's investment has sparked interest and innovation, the mass market remains unconvinced. The question that lingers is whether Meta can successfully pitch the next generation of personal computing to a mainstream audience before its competitors catch up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bfnlnf4jzxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=316d2640c873f6d3a7380d9c9b1734ad5a294037\n\n# Broader Implications for Other Markets\n\nThe potential success or failure of Reality Labs could extend beyond Meta and have far-reaching implications for adjacent markets. If Meta’s bet pays off, several key trends could emerge:\n\nFirstly, success in AR and VR would likely trigger increased volatility in the tech sector as major companies reposition themselves to avoid being left behind. Companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft are already monitoring Meta's progress closely. Apple’s entry into the AR market with its Vision Pro headset signifies that Meta is not alone in pursuing this opportunity. As competition intensifies, other firms will be compelled to escalate their investments in AR and VR technologies, causing shifts in market dynamics and strategic priorities.\n\nAdditionally, a successful push by Meta could drive increased demand for specialized hardware and semiconductor components necessary for AR and VR devices. Investors in hardware manufacturing or semiconductor companies could benefit significantly from a boom in these markets. High-end lenses, sensors, GPUs, and specialized chips would be essential in producing advanced AR and VR headsets, creating lucrative opportunities for suppliers.\n\nFinally, Meta’s efforts to build a developer ecosystem around its devices could lead to the emergence of new market opportunities in content and software development. As more developers create applications for AR and VR platforms, there will be increased demand for creative and practical content across sectors like gaming, education, remote work, and healthcare.\n\n[\\\\\"Andean Precious Metals: Leading the charge in responsible mining across South America's rich mineral landscapes.\\\\\" \\(TSX-V: APM | OTCQX: ANPMF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1gpjb941jzxd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c43e4b328a29a631c2e5fafdbe4fa392dc825457)\n\n# Risks to Consider: Is Meta Overextending?\n\nDespite the optimism around Meta’s technological advancements, there are considerable risks to weigh. One of the most immediate concerns is whether consumer adoption will align with Meta’s projections. Even with Orion and the latest VR headsets generating buzz, the broader market acceptance of these devices remains uncertain. Meta must prove not just technological superiority but also mainstream relevance—a task that has eluded many past innovators.\n\nMoreover, competition poses a real threat to Meta’s ambitions. Apple’s Vision Pro and Alphabet’s investments in AR are reminders that Meta’s journey won’t be without rivals. Meta may find it challenging to establish dominance in a market where other tech giants are also committed to staking their claims.\n\nLastly, economic conditions can’t be ignored. Significant losses within Reality Labs may eventually force Meta to re-evaluate its budget allocation, especially if macroeconomic conditions worsen. Even large companies are not immune to budget cuts in periods of economic uncertainty, which could delay or derail ambitious projects like the metaverse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5eyncboyjzxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dbf72211cf30e17ddd502cdbf1363ac14bed8a3\n\n# Balancing Fear and Opportunity\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs initiative is one of the boldest and riskiest ventures in contemporary technology. For investors, understanding Meta’s strategy requires a blend of cautious optimism and practical skepticism. Are you willing to believe in Zuckerberg’s vision of redefining personal computing and invest during these turbulent times? Or does the potential financial risk outweigh the visionary narrative?\n\nUltimately, this isn’t just a story about Meta—it’s about the future of technology and its implications for investors. Whether Meta’s ambitious investments lead to a new paradigm or an expensive lesson in overreach remains to be seen. Investors need to stay vigilant, not just for signs of Meta’s success, but for the broader ripple effects its strategy could have on the entire tech industry. The future, as always, belongs to those willing to embrace calculated risks and opportunities amidst uncertainty.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1730334224.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gg1rhb/metas_reality_labs_the_44_billion_question_for/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gg1rhb/metas_reality_labs_the_44_billion_question_for/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1gfaw02", "title": "Why Gold’s Rise Signals an Opportunity to Embrace “Stacking” for Long-Term Security", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Gold prices have been on an incredible trajectory, surging to nearly $2,800 per ounce. This rise reflects not just short-term market fluctuations, but a shift in how investors are thinking about their financial futures. Amid geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy shifts, and looming political uncertainties, the demand for gold and silver is surging—creating what analysts call a “perfect storm” for these precious metals.\n\nHowever, while market analysts debate the exact catalysts, the real story isn’t just about short-term price movements. It’s about a broader, strategic shift toward owning physical metals—what investors often call “stacking.” Let’s explore why this practice is increasingly relevant today and why it may be the smartest move you can make.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy17s7kbmsxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e128878f1d9a0415f4e662145c3f4d1ea248ebd5\n\n# Physical Metals as a Foundation of Wealth\n\nInvesting in physical gold and silver—owning actual coins, bars, and bullion—is more than a hedge against market volatility; it’s a proactive step toward long-term wealth preservation. Unlike digital assets or paper investments like stocks and bonds, which can be wiped out by a market crash, physical metals are tangible and immune to such external risks. A gold coin in your hand holds intrinsic value that remains independent of political headlines, policy shifts, or even systemic financial upheavals.\n\nIn a world where fiat currencies are continually devalued by inflation and debt, stacking precious metals is akin to laying down the foundation of a stable financial future. You’re not merely trading dollars for commodities; you’re exchanging uncertainty for permanence, fear for stability. By stacking, you are securing real, physical wealth in a chaotic world—a hedge not only against monetary risks but also against geopolitical turbulence.\n\n# Psychological Appeal: Gold and Silver as Symbols of Stability\n\nThe rise in gold prices isn’t just driven by institutional demand; there’s also a psychological factor at play. In times of uncertainty, people instinctively gravitate towards symbols of stability and value. Gold and silver have been those symbols for thousands of years. They represent safety and solidity in a world that often feels unpredictable.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, stacking physical metals taps into our innate desire to have something real, something lasting. When you hold an ounce of gold or silver in your hand, you’re holding centuries of human trust and history—a legacy that transcends short-term market trends or political crises. This is what makes stacking not just financially wise, but psychologically empowering.\n\n# Hedge Against Systemic Risks\n\nThe financial system today is riddled with vulnerabilities, from burgeoning national debts to the relentless printing of currency. Central banks are keenly aware of this, which is why they’ve been aggressively increasing their gold reserves, particularly in emerging markets. This institutional demand underscores a critical truth: gold and silver are not just commodities; they’re strategic hedges against systemic risks.\n\nWhen you stack precious metals, you’re aligning yourself with these same risk-averse principles. It’s about insulating yourself from currency devaluation, credit market disruptions, and geopolitical chaos. Gold and silver don’t merely act as hedges; they provide you with a lifeline—a means of retaining purchasing power when everything else seems to be losing value.\n\n[Average Precious Metals Investor](https://preview.redd.it/zkka6tmjnsxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4b4fb46d3634a69131a1b1107d9f5d7e55d9262)\n\n# Stacking Builds Resilience in Uncertain Times\n\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, escalating tensions in the Middle East, and even central banks diversifying away from the U.S. dollar are not isolated events—they’re all parts of a larger, more unstable global landscape. Stacking physical metals allows you to rise above the noise of these events. It’s not about being reactionary; it’s about proactively positioning yourself for the future.\n\nConsider the context: We’re on the cusp of a U.S. presidential election that could bring sweeping policy changes, increased fiscal stimulus, and a ballooning budget deficit. While these elements can inject more uncertainty into the market, gold and silver offer a stabilizing anchor amid the chaos. By stacking, you’re making a conscious choice to step out of this whirlwind and establish your own financial resilience.\n\n[\\\\\"Dolly Varden Silver: Your gateway to high-grade silver discoveries in British Columbia's Golden Triangle.\\\\\" \\(TSX.V:DV | OTCQX:DOLLF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hkcr5innsxd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ca9963074a99faa388fd264e749799e74f137c1)\n\n# Gold and Silver as Long-Term Investments in Stability\n\nUnlike digital investments that can vanish with a power outage or paper assets that are vulnerable to market sentiment, physical gold and silver are not subject to external tampering. They exist as real, immutable wealth that isn’t at the mercy of a fluctuating market or a risky policy decision. This is a crucial point: Stacking is not just a bet on future price increases. It’s an acknowledgment of what is enduring and valuable.\n\nIn this way, stacking is about more than short-term financial gain; it’s about building a legacy. When you accumulate physical metals, you’re taking a stand against financial erosion, political instability, and a system that is increasingly built on a house of cards. You’re investing in what has historically proven to be stable, reliable, and above all—real.\n\n[Embrace the Stacking](https://preview.redd.it/istta8wqmsxd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4043d926b9f1e2ef02993fdbe76e1aadf207f7f4)\n\n# Embrace Stacking as a Strategic Advantage\n\nGold’s rise to nearly $2,800 per ounce is not a fluke or a fleeting trend. It’s the culmination of multiple factors coming together to create a perfect storm—a signal for investors to reevaluate their strategies and embrace stacking as a viable path forward. Stacking physical metals isn’t just about riding a price wave or chasing gains; it’s about establishing a solid foundation for the future.\n\nAt a time when uncertainty is pervasive and geopolitical risks abound, owning gold and silver isn’t merely smart—it’s essential. It’s about insulating yourself from the chaos and investing in something that offers stability, longevity, and real value. The market may continue to shift, and prices may fluctuate, but the advantages of stacking remain steadfast. By owning physical gold and silver, you’re not just investing—you’re safeguarding your financial future and embracing a philosophy of resilience and wisdom.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1730250721.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gfaw02/why_golds_rise_signals_an_opportunity_to_embrace/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gfaw02/why_golds_rise_signals_an_opportunity_to_embrace/", "subreddit": "investment"}

{"id": "1gd2bke", "title": "Trump’s Bold Proposal: Eliminating Federal Income Taxes in Favor of Tariffs", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has unveiled a radical shift in tax policy that could fundamentally reshape how America’s economy functions. During an interview with Joe Rogan, Trump doubled down on a vision to completely eliminate federal income taxes and fund government operations through tariffs. This isn’t just a small tweak—it’s a bold, ambitious move that challenges the current economic framework. For many, it presents an appealing narrative of keeping more hard-earned money and focusing on domestic economic independence. But can tariffs alone carry the weight of federal revenues? Let’s explore the core elements and implications of this plan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3ci8be1y7xd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2014948c0c079cf5eeb1f3a5182bcaf3b2bff7\n\n# A Big Idea: No More Federal Income Taxes\n\nWhen Joe Rogan asked Trump if he was serious about replacing income taxes with tariffs, Trump didn’t hesitate. “Yeah, sure, but why not?” he said, conveying the confidence that has always characterized his big ideas. At the heart of this plan is the concept of stopping foreign competitors from exploiting the American market without paying their dues. And Trump’s answer is straightforward: tariffs.\n\nThe proposal involves eliminating federal income taxes on key areas like tipped income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits. Trump also plans to renew his 2017 tax cuts and introduce exemptions for critical workers, including police, firefighters, military personnel, and veterans. To replace this revenue, Trump proposes a flat 20% tariff on all imports, with a special focus on Chinese goods.\n\n# The Perks of Eliminating Income Taxes\n\nFor American workers, the immediate benefits of eliminating federal income taxes are hard to overstate. By lifting taxes on tipped and overtime income, Trump’s plan directly acknowledges and rewards the backbone of the American labor force. Tipped workers, overtime earners, and Social Security recipients would see substantial boosts in their take-home pay. And in a time when every dollar counts, this extra income could go a long way toward improving the quality of life for millions of Americans.\n\nTrump’s tax plan also promises a simpler and more transparent tax system. The current income tax framework is often criticized for its complexity and red tape, which drains both time and resources. Moving away from income taxes towards tariffs creates a model that’s easier for workers to understand and navigate.\n\n# Tariffs: A New Revenue Stream with Potential\n\nTariffs are the linchpin of Trump’s plan to replace income taxes. The idea is to make it more expensive for foreign companies to flood the U.S. market with cheap imports, pushing them to contribute their fair share. Trump’s focus on tariffs is not just about generating revenue; it’s about promoting economic self-sufficiency and strengthening American manufacturing.\n\nBy imposing a 20% tariff on all imports, Trump seeks to revive domestic industries and discourage offshoring. The plan aims to create a resurgence in manufacturing jobs and make American-made goods more competitive. If executed properly, tariffs could act as a powerful tool to reclaim economic sovereignty and promote local production.\n\n# What This Means for Investors\n\nThe implications of Trump’s plan for investors are intriguing. With no federal income tax to worry about, American workers would likely spend more, boosting revenues in consumer-driven sectors like retail, dining, and travel. Increased disposable income could lead to a rise in consumer confidence and stimulate the economy in the short term.\n\nFor savvy investors, there are also opportunities in industries that stand to gain from a tariff-heavy environment. Sectors like manufacturing, construction, and logistics could experience growth as more production shifts back to U.S. soil. Domestic-focused companies may find themselves in a uniquely advantageous position as tariffs make foreign goods less competitive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xzmlmpnz7xd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d89639ec11a62cbebe12b70af07730a5bc79504b\n\n# Addressing Revenue Concerns\n\nOf course, the main question on everyone’s mind is whether tariffs can generate enough revenue to replace income taxes. Critics argue that tariffs alone might not cover the shortfall. The Tax Foundation estimates that Trump’s tariffs could raise around $3.8 trillion over ten years—substantially less than the $33 trillion projected from income taxes over the same period.\n\nSkeptics also worry about the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. While Trump asserts that tariffs are paid by foreign producers, history and economic studies show that increased import costs tend to trickle down to consumers. Higher prices could undermine some of the benefits of income tax relief, particularly for lower-income households.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the thrill of discovery with Outcrop Silver, leading the charge in Colombia's precious metal sector.\\\\\" \\(CA: TSX.V: OCG US: OTCQX: OCGSF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bzrcrrpay7xd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd1063d110a29ffd311a25d64d6ae3dc622ad3d7)\n\n# A New Direction for Economic Policy\n\nTrump’s vision represents a significant departure from traditional economic policy. By eliminating income taxes and focusing on tariffs, he is advocating for a simpler, more transparent approach that rewards hard work and strengthens American independence. It’s a philosophy rooted in economic nationalism and a desire to bring back industries lost to globalization.\n\nThe appeal of this plan is clear: more money in the hands of workers, a renewed focus on American production, and a streamlined tax system. But it’s important to weigh these benefits against the challenges of relying heavily on tariffs. The potential for increased consumer prices and the revenue gap remain key concerns.\n\n[No Income Tax!? A Pipe Dream?](https://preview.redd.it/6cu3nhq3z7xd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a062e68424cf453e53315f46e7f6a706ed339c)\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nTrump’s proposal to eliminate federal income taxes in favor of tariffs is nothing short of revolutionary. It challenges decades of entrenched economic thinking and offers a vision of a simpler tax code and an “America First” agenda. For workers, the promise of keeping more of their hard-earned income is undeniably appealing. For domestic industries, the emphasis on tariffs represents a chance to regain market share and reclaim jobs lost to foreign competition.\n\nWhile critics caution about the risks of tariffs and the potential for increased prices, the allure of this vision lies in its simplicity and its promise of economic independence. Trump’s plan isn’t just about taxes—it’s a vision for reshaping America’s economic landscape, creating opportunities for growth, and restoring faith in the American dream.\n\nFor voters and investors, the key will be weighing the benefits of financial independence against the broader consequences of a tariff-heavy strategy. Disruptive by design, Trump’s plan offers a clear choice: stick with the old rules, or embrace a new era of American prosperity.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1730000515.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gd2bke/trumps_bold_proposal_eliminating_federal_income/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gd2bke/trumps_bold_proposal_eliminating_federal_income/", "subreddit": "investment"}

This momentous surge is the highest we’ve seen since late July, reflecting the dynamic interplay of Federal Reserve commentary and the latest economic indicators. For investors, this is more than just numbers—it's a signal that could reshape strategies and lead to new opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdsprctwylwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab66fecce3f5690614869d78cb849984a5a0c69\n\n# The Rise of Treasury Yields\n\nOn a bustling Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed more than three basis points to about 4.24%. At one point, it soared to an impressive 4.26%, sending waves through the investment community. This shift follows a remarkable increase of 12 basis points just a few days earlier, breaking the 4.2% threshold. The 2-year Treasury yield also showed signs of life, hitting 4.06%, underlining the broader trends at play.\n\nWhat’s driving this uptick? A cocktail of robust economic data and rising deficit concerns is causing traders to rethink their strategies. Even after a half-point rate cut from the Fed in September, anxiety is mounting that the central bank might not continue its easing path. The commentary from Fed officials has injected a sense of uncertainty, leaving many to ponder what this means for interest rates moving forward.\n\n# The Fed's Impact\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s recent comments have sparked considerable market activity, making it a critical player in the current financial narrative. While the central bank has indicated potential rate cuts, traders are increasingly wary. Recent speeches from Fed officials have suggested a more cautious approach to rate adjustments, particularly given the backdrop of strong economic performance and significant fiscal challenges.\n\nWith key policymakers voicing their perspectives this week, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman at the 8th Annual Fintech Conference, all eyes are on these discussions. Investors are keen to decipher what these insights could mean for the future trajectory of interest rates.\n\n# What It Means for Equities and Investment Strategies\n\nAs Treasury yields continue their upward march, equities are feeling the heat. U.S. stock futures have taken a dip, following a pattern of losses for the S&amp;P 500—the first back-to-back declines since early September.

These equities are often most affected by increased borrowing costs, as higher yields can lead to significant revaluations. A strategic pivot might be in order—investors should consider diversifying their holdings into sectors that traditionally thrive when interest rates rise, such as financials and energy.\n\nMoreover, now is the perfect time to focus on dividend-paying stocks. These can provide a reliable income stream, helping to cushion portfolios against market volatility.\n\n[\\\\\"Unlock the potential of high-grade silver with Kuya Silver, leading the way in efficient mining operations.\\\\\" \\(CSE: KUYA | OTCQB: KUYAF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nh4713z5ylwd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9da4274cacde569f080afc33ccff005a84f6e3)\n\n# Exploring Fixed-Income Opportunities\n\nOn the flip side, rising yields open the door for enticing opportunities in the fixed-income market. For conservative investors, the appeal of newly issued bonds with higher rates is compelling. Investing in Treasuries or other bonds now can lock in attractive yields that may not be available in the future as rates fluctuate.\n\nAdditionally, bond investors should assess the duration of their holdings. Shorter-duration bonds can offer greater protection against interest rate risks, as they are less susceptible to shifts in yields. This strategic approach allows investors to benefit from the current yield environment while minimizing potential losses.\n\n[Investment Opportunities? ](https://preview.redd.it/kpfuhawbylwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22c3fe62ba2b38f2713481853ce87af16ae43e5b)\n\n# What This Means for Investors\n\nAs we dissect the implications of the recent spike in the 10-year Treasury yield, it’s clear that a proactive and adaptable mindset is essential for investors. The intricate relationship between interest rates and market performance can be daunting, but the current environment is ripe with both challenges and opportunities.\n\nVigilance is key. Investors should keep a close watch on the comments from Federal Reserve officials and key economic indicators that might influence monetary policy. With the upcoming release of the Fed’s Beige Book and speeches from influential policymakers, there's a wealth of insights to be gleaned that could impact market trajectories.\n\nThe surge in the 10-year Treasury yield is more than just a financial statistic—it’s a reflection of economic realities and investor sentiment.

As Tesla finds itself navigating an increasingly crowded electric vehicle (EV) market, investors need to carefully weigh the risks and rewards tied to the company’s performance and Musk’s ever-present influence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7q4lnrscjlwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab537df875cc4d2c7a423831cf11cc88dfa93a0\n\n# Profits and Regulatory Credits: A Double-Edged Sword\n\nTesla beat Wall Street’s expectations on earnings per share, reporting 72 cents adjusted versus the 58 cents expected. However, revenue fell just short at $25.18 billion, compared to the $25.37 billion target. The company managed to boost its profit margins significantly, partly thanks to $739 million in regulatory credit revenue.\n\nThese environmental credits represent a financial lifeline, enabling Tesla to generate additional profit by selling credits to automakers that fail to meet regulatory requirements. While this strategy has boosted earnings, it also highlights Tesla’s reliance on these credits to maintain profitability. The key question for investors is whether Tesla’s financial results are sustainable without these regulatory windfalls.\n\n[Electric Vehicle Market &amp; Quality Control](https://preview.redd.it/qwoi0dedilwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e84600797754c8f6ae04259f506e5fb177122d)\n\n# Cybertruck: Success or Stumble?\n\nTesla touted the Cybertruck as the third best-selling EV in the United States, trailing only the Model 3 and Model Y. The company managed to sell over 16,000 Cybertrucks in the third quarter despite widely reported quality issues. Tesla claims the Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, but the model’s launch has not been without its problems. Concerns over build quality suggest that Tesla is still grappling with scaling new production lines efficiently.\n\nFor investors, this raises a cautionary flag. While the Cybertruck’s initial sales show the strength of Tesla’s brand loyalty, production problems hint at potential challenges in maintaining momentum. Should quality issues persist, consumer confidence could waver, impacting future sales and profitability.\n\n[\\\\\"Discover the brilliance of sustainable mining with Andean Precious Metals, your gateway to ethical silver and gold production.\\\\\" \\(TSX-V: APM | OTCQX: ANPMF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/nsayw9pgilwd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f858bcd44c4fa700e5a82ff411d8a7335c23dfe)\n\n# Competition and Tesla’s Future Strategy\n\nTesla’s ambitious growth targets face growing headwinds from competition, particularly in the Chinese market, where brands like BYD and Nio are aggressively gaining ground. In the U.S., legacy automakers such as Ford and General Motors are ramping up their EV offerings, even as they scale back earlier commitments.\n\nIn response, Musk projected vehicle growth of 20-30% in 2024, driven by the rollout of lower-cost models and advancements in autonomy. However, investors should approach these projections with skepticism. Tesla has repeatedly promised breakthroughs in autonomous driving technology, yet it remains far from delivering a truly driverless vehicle. Musk’s claim that Tesla produces 35,000 \"capable of autonomy\" vehicles each week sounds impressive, but the reality is that none of these cars can operate without human supervision.\n\nThe big issue here is execution. Tesla has a history of making bold promises only to encounter delays and regulatory hurdles. Investors who are counting on autonomy to drive future growth should keep in mind the significant technological and legal challenges that still stand in Tesla’s way.\n\n[Cult of Personality ](https://preview.redd.it/ap1r4100klwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86bee775790ed01fb39e3d56abfc8086ba8bc287)\n\n# The Cult of Personality and Political Risks\n\nThere’s no denying that Elon Musk commands a powerful following—both within the company and among investors. His charisma and forward-looking vision have helped build Tesla’s loyal base, creating a “cult of personality” around him. This loyalty can be a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, it allows Musk to rally public enthusiasm for new products and initiatives, even when the fundamentals aren’t fully in place. On the other hand, it can blind investors to operational challenges and competitive threats.\n\nMusk’s increasing political involvement further complicates Tesla’s outlook. He has publicly thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump and directed millions of dollars into the 2024 campaign. However, Trump’s policies are historically at odds with the types of federal subsidies and regulations that have helped Tesla succeed. Musk’s political activism may alienate some investors and lead to unpredictable regulatory consequences.\n\n# Can Investors Benefit?\n\nThe question every investor should ask is: *Does the potential reward outweigh the risk?* Tesla’s recent stock jump is encouraging in the short term, and there are certainly reasons to be optimistic. The company continues to lead in EV sales and is expanding its energy generation and storage revenue rapidly. But challenges loom large. Rising competition, quality concerns, and the overhanging reliance on regulatory credits are genuine threats to Tesla’s long-term growth.\n\nInvestors who have placed their faith in Musk and Tesla’s potential may benefit from holding the stock if the company can successfully expand its lower-cost vehicle lineup and improve its autonomous driving capabilities. But these gains are not guaranteed. Betting on Tesla is, in many ways, a bet on Elon Musk—a leader with an unmatched ability to capture public imagination, but whose vision sometimes outpaces reality.\n\n[Allure &amp; Risk](https://preview.redd.it/yyl0d6mallwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5b30e4c07ddc3743b4e3c812d4446de4d8dc2b1)\n\n# The Allure and Risk of Tesla\n\nTesla’s third-quarter earnings highlight both the company’s strengths and its vulnerabilities. The reliance on regulatory credits, the uncertainty around new products like the Cybertruck, and the increasing competition from well-funded rivals all suggest that Tesla is at a critical juncture. Investors would be wise to look beyond the headlines and carefully consider how much risk they are willing to take on.\n\nThe allure of Tesla and its enigmatic leader is undeniable. But as the market tightens and Musk’s political aspirations draw more attention, investors must balance their admiration for his ambitions with the hard realities of running a global automaker in an increasingly crowded EV market.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1729729424.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1gaprdg/teslas_earnings_profits_promises_and_the_power_of/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1gaprdg/teslas_earnings_profits_promises_and_the_power_of/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1ga0cwb", "title": "Polish Defense Spending Opens New Horizons for Boeing and Investors", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "The Polish government is considering a major defense purchase that could be a significant win for Boeing, as Poland mulls acquiring CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. Announced by Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, the potential acquisition is part of Poland’s broader strategy to modernize its military and strengthen ties with the United States. This comes on the heels of a $10 billion contract Poland recently signed for 96 AH-64E Apache helicopters, solidifying Boeing’s position as a trusted defense supplier to the country.\n\nFor investors, this potential Chinook deal represents more than just another contract for Boeing—it’s a strategic move that underscores the company’s ability to adapt to global demands and capitalize on shifting geopolitical trends. Boeing’s success in securing high-profile deals with Poland sets the stage for long-term growth and profitability, making it an attractive stock for those seeking stability and opportunity in the defense sector.\n\n[Potential Boeing Deal In Poland](https://preview.redd.it/tsdj1hbq5fwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=279d993895c73e6fe398db519f3812b81c1b1046)\n\n# A Winning Formula for Boeing and Its Investors\n\nFor Boeing, landing the Chinook deal would strengthen its foothold in the European defense market, where military spending is ramping up amid rising security concerns. The CH-47F Chinook, known for its heavy-lift capabilities and versatility, fits Poland’s requirements for military and disaster relief operations, making it a strong contender in the ongoing discussions.\n\nThis potential deal isn’t just a one-time opportunity; it signals a broader trend of deepening ties between Boeing and European defense markets. As Eastern Europe continues to increase its defense budgets, Boeing is well-positioned to secure additional contracts for helicopters, aircraft, and other defense products. Each new contract presents not only immediate revenue but also long-term opportunities for maintenance, training, and upgrades, all of which can translate into recurring revenue streams.\n\nFor investors, Boeing’s expanding portfolio in Europe presents an enticing opportunity. The potential Chinook contract, combined with Poland’s recent Apache purchase, highlights Boeing’s resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape. As the company continues to secure lucrative international deals, its stock is likely to experience increased stability and growth potential.\n\n# Future Opportunities: What Investors Should Watch For\n\nBoeing’s growing success in Poland and other European markets is part of a larger narrative. The company’s ongoing deals signal that Boeing is actively responding to the increasing demand for advanced military equipment in the face of geopolitical tensions. As Eastern European countries like Poland continue to upgrade their military capabilities, demand for versatile, reliable equipment like the Chinook is expected to rise.\n\nFor investors, these developments mean a potential boost in Boeing’s stock price and dividends over the long term. Defense contracts, particularly those tied to NATO allies, tend to be stable and less susceptible to economic fluctuations. This consistency provides Boeing with a reliable revenue stream that investors can count on, even during periods of market volatility.\n\nIn the short term, securing the Chinook deal would likely lift investor sentiment and drive the stock price higher. Over the longer term, the continued expansion of Boeing’s defense portfolio could lead to sustained stock price appreciation and increased dividend payouts, making Boeing an attractive option for those seeking growth and income.\n\n[Polish Military Modernization](https://preview.redd.it/cavtwx4u6fwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fc31509379609f7cf0fd02574dc35e534952d0e)\n\n# The Bigger Picture: Polish Defense Spending and Its Impact\n\nPoland’s growing defense budget isn’t just an isolated development—it’s part of a broader trend across Europe. In response to heightened security concerns, Poland is investing heavily in military modernization, with a focus on acquiring advanced equipment from U.S. and global suppliers. This creates significant opportunities not only for Boeing but also for other major defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Hyundai.\n\nLockheed Martin, which already supplies Poland with fighter jets and missile systems, stands to benefit from the country’s ongoing push to strengthen its military. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s interest in the region’s armored vehicle market positions the company to capture additional contracts as Poland and its neighbors look to modernize their ground forces.\n\nFor investors, Poland’s increased spending is a signal that the defense industry is poised for growth. As Eastern European nations continue to upgrade their military capabilities, demand for advanced defense products is likely to remain strong, providing a solid growth trajectory for companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Hyundai.\n\n[Join Dolly Varden Silver on a journey of growth and discovery, as we redefine excellence in silver mining.\\\\\" TSX.V:DV | OTCQX:DOLLF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2c07brni6fwd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4b12aee7b84146103dc1ba7c32b8ba2c1b26546)\n\n# Investing in the Future of Defense: A Compelling Case\n\nAs geopolitical tensions rise and nations prioritize their defense capabilities, companies like Boeing are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for military equipment. For investors, this presents a compelling opportunity to tap into a sector with strong growth potential and reliable revenue streams.\n\nBoeing’s success in securing key contracts with Poland indicates that the company is effectively navigating this shifting landscape. By focusing on versatile, high-demand products like the Chinook and Apache helicopters, Boeing is setting itself up for continued success in the years to come. This adaptability, combined with its strong international presence, makes Boeing a solid investment choice for those seeking to capitalize on defense sector growth.\n\nLooking forward, investors should keep an eye on additional contracts and partnerships Boeing may secure in Europe and beyond. As Poland and other countries ramp up their defense spending, the potential for follow-on deals and additional services contracts increases. This creates an opportunity for investors to benefit not only from immediate gains but also from the long-term growth of Boeing’s defense business.\n\n[Expansion in European Markets](https://preview.redd.it/253maspr6fwd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d4ee0bcbdc090ae92fef673b750e54b832a1fc)\n\n# What Does This All Mean?\n\nPoland’s interest in Boeing’s Chinook helicopters is more than just another defense contract—it’s a signal of Boeing’s strategic expansion into key European markets. For investors, this represents a promising opportunity to benefit from Boeing’s growing presence in the defense sector, which offers stability, growth potential, and consistent revenue streams.\n\nAs Poland continues to invest in its military and modernize its forces, the demand for advanced defense solutions is set to increase. For Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Hyundai, this trend presents opportunities to secure lucrative contracts and expand their market share. For investors, this evolving landscape provides a chance to align their portfolios with companies poised for long-term success.\n\nBy investing in Boeing and other defense companies, savvy investors can capitalize on a growing industry that is well-positioned to thrive amid rising global tensions and increased defense spending.

{"id": "1g9vuss", "title": "Philip Morris: A Growth Stock Resurrected by Zyn Demand", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "In a remarkable turnaround, Philip Morris International (PMI) has once again positioned itself as a growth stock, with its shares hitting record highs thanks to a surge in demand for its Zyn brand of oral nicotine pouches. This momentous occasion saw the stock reach an intraday peak of **$131.97**, marking a significant milestone for the company and a departure from its previous image as merely a dividend play. For investors, this newfound vitality is not just a fluke; it signals a shift in consumer preferences and the company's strategic focus on innovative, smoke-free products.\n\nPrior to the advent of Zyn, Swedish Match was primarily known in the U.S. for its Swedish Snus product, **General Snus**. This traditional smokeless tobacco product laid the groundwork for PMI's entry into the modern oral nicotine market. However, Zyn has since eclipsed General Snus, transforming Philip Morris into a key player in a booming category that appeals to a younger, health-conscious demographic. With the company's acquisition of Swedish Match two years ago, PMI has leveraged its expertise and resources to catapult Zyn to the forefront of the smokeless tobacco market.\n\n[Did Somebody Say Growth Stock?!](https://preview.redd.it/tqjgd4531ewd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06354c3e4a1a4f8333767ca52b925df5a7ed4c7b)\n\n# A Resurgence Fueled by Consumer Demand\n\nPhilip Morris’s resurgence can largely be attributed to the **soaring demand for Zyn**. The company recently reported an astonishing increase in shipments of its oral nicotine pouches, with a nearly **40% rise** in shipments during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the previous year. In the third quarter alone, shipments of Zyn cans in the U.S. jumped over **41%**, showcasing a significant recovery from earlier supply constraints. Finance chief Emmanuel Babeau emphasized this point, noting that the **\"No. 1 U.S. smoke-free brand\"** continues to demonstrate strong underlying momentum.\n\nWhat does this mean for the average investor? The stock’s transformation from a stagnant, dividend-focused entity into a growth stock represents a unique opportunity. As traders begin to recognize Zyn's potential and its impact on Philip Morris's overall financial health, the stock's appeal is likely to continue rising. The company not only exceeded analysts' expectations for the third quarter but also raised its full-year earnings per share outlook, further solidifying its position in the market.\n\n[Global Expansion](https://preview.redd.it/3u7zrmyq1ewd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66276a79a5f3aeec1db3b4cea546db45e732e8b)\n\n# International Expansion: A Global Strategy\n\nZyn's success is not confined to U.S. borders. The brand has seen tremendous growth internationally, with total nicotine pouch volume outside America soaring nearly **70%** between the third quarters of 2023 and 2024. Zyn is now available in **30 markets**, following successful expansions into countries like Greece and the Czech Republic. This global strategy is crucial for Philip Morris as it seeks to diversify its revenue streams and lessen its reliance on traditional tobacco products.\n\nThe investment landscape for tobacco companies is changing, and Zyn is at the forefront of this transformation. The ongoing shift toward smoke-free alternatives is becoming more pronounced, as evidenced by Philip Morris’s decision to invest **$600 million** in a new production facility for Zyn in Colorado. This commitment underscores the company's dedication to innovation and responsiveness to market trends.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the power of premium silver assets with Dolly Varden Silver, a leader in Canada's resource-rich landscape.\\\\\" \\(TSX.V:DV | OTCQX:DOLLF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7gflbxos1ewd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=645ec45112457f5151c37d92fbdaf86f9c15de5d)\n\n# A Shift in Perception\n\nThe past decade has seen Philip Morris's stock price stagnant, particularly between 2013 and 2023, as investors viewed the company as merely a dividend play in a declining industry. However, the narrative has shifted dramatically. The stock has climbed nearly **40%** in 2024 alone, setting the stage for what could be the best year on record for the company.\n\nIn contrast, Altria, which retained the U.S. cigarette unit, has struggled significantly, with its shares remaining far below their all-time high reached in 2017. This divergence highlights the strategic foresight of Philip Morris as it focuses on smoke-free alternatives while Altria grapples with the declining traditional cigarette market. The company’s ability to pivot effectively away from combustible products may well define its success moving forward.\n\n[Zyn + Zoomers](https://preview.redd.it/q7xxtww52ewd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5299d7bc398ae7c8237261d433541941850e5e39)\n\n# The Future of Philip Morris and Zyn\n\nAs Philip Morris navigates this new landscape, the growth of Zyn represents not just a product success story, but a broader strategic pivot that aligns with changing consumer behaviors. For investors, this is an opportune moment to consider the potential of PMI as a growth stock, especially as Zyn continues to capture consumer interest and expand into new markets.\n\nThe resurgence of Philip Morris illustrates a vital lesson in the world of investing: adaptability is key. The ability to innovate and respond to market demands can turn a stagnant company into a thriving enterprise. As Zyn solidifies its position as a leader in the smokeless tobacco market, Philip Morris stands to benefit from a transformed perception, opening up new avenues for growth and profitability. In a market where traditional tobacco faces increasing scrutiny, Zyn’s ascent offers a promising glimpse into the future of the industry.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1729638519.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g9vuss/philip_morris_a_growth_stock_resurrected_by_zyn/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g9vuss/philip_morris_a_growth_stock_resurrected_by_zyn/", "subreddit": "investment"}

{"id": "1g7o2xg", "title": "Silver: The Ultimate Investment Amid a Looming Supply Deficit", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "In 2024, silver has taken center stage as one of the most promising investments in the precious metals sector. Despite a slow start to the year, silver prices have surged nearly 34%, outperforming many other assets. This upward momentum is not a fluke—it is a reflection of deeper structural changes in the silver market, both in terms of industrial demand and an ever-widening supply deficit. As the global economy continues to evolve, silver is becoming indispensable, making it a valuable asset for both short-term gains and long-term stability.\n\nFor investors seeking a sound opportunity, silver presents a unique case of bullish potential. With the market expected to face a supply shortfall of 215.3 million ounces, the second-largest deficit in over two decades, this metal is poised for significant price appreciation. In this article, we will delve into why physical silver is not only a safe investment but also a vital one for the future. We’ll explore silver’s growing industrial applications, its irreplaceable role in modern technology, and why demand will continue to outpace supply for years to come.\n\n[Silver: The Ultimate Investment](https://preview.redd.it/pplfj5bjetvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e020d6263f0c06a5153ba122a12fd2ffb96eaef)\n\n# Silver’s Ever-Growing Industrial Demand\n\nSilver’s reputation as a \"do-it-all\" metal is well-earned. It has critical applications across various industries, from electronics and renewable energy to medical devices and electric vehicles. As Mitchell Krebs, CEO of Coeur Mining, pointed out, the global push toward electrification is set to drive silver demand higher than ever. The metal's superior conductivity makes it essential for manufacturing everything from solar panels to 5G devices, creating a scenario where industrial demand alone could absorb much of the available supply.\n\nMatt Watson, founder of Precious Metals Commodity Management, emphasized that the future of electronics will heavily rely on silver, describing the outlook for growth in this sector as \"phenomenal.\" Given the sheer range of its applications, there is no viable substitute for silver in many key technologies. Whether it's in the wiring of electric vehicles or the components of semiconductors, silver is irreplaceable.\n\n[Mining Silver to Meet Demand](https://preview.redd.it/aaugq0ccetvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e20ab71f09130a6dead584b2ec9b38862ff22e4)\n\n# The Supply Crisis: A Bottleneck That Drives Value\n\nOne of the most persuasive arguments for investing in silver is the looming supply crisis. According to industry experts, the mining sector is struggling to keep up with demand, and even if a major silver deposit were discovered today, it would take two decades for that silver to enter the market. This lag is due to the lengthy processes required for exploration, permitting, and construction.\n\nKrebs noted that we are simply not producing enough silver to meet the current demand, let alone the projected increases. This growing imbalance between supply and demand creates a long-term bullish outlook for silver prices. As the Silver Institute reported, global silver demand is expected to reach 1.219 billion ounces this year—a 2% increase from 2023. Given the production bottlenecks, this gap between supply and demand will only widen, further supporting higher prices.\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the thrill of discovery with Outcrop Silver, leading the charge in Colombia's precious metal sector.\\\\\" \\(CA: TSX.V: OCG US: OTCQX: OCGSF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/lgw4ey2wetvd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=631299b2884894e8c8ab9c7fe6e6aa94c6d12536)\n\n# Why Physical Silver is a Strong Investment\n\nPhysical silver offers unique advantages over other forms of investment. It is a tangible asset, immune to the whims of digital markets or the policies of central banks. In an era of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and currency devaluation, silver acts as a hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will, silver's supply is constrained by physical realities. This scarcity is becoming more pronounced as industrial demand accelerates and mining production struggles to keep pace.\n\nMoreover, silver is far more affordable than gold, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. For those looking to diversify their portfolios without the high entry cost of gold, silver presents an attractive alternative. Its liquidity is high, with strong demand for both industrial applications and investment products like coins and bars. In times of economic downturn, the intrinsic value of physical silver shines, providing a safe haven for wealth preservation.\n\n[Silver is a critical component in several high-tech industries, including military technology, where it’s used in precision electronics; solar panels, enhancing energy efficiency; electronics, powering everything from smartphones to computers; and electric vehicles, where it's essential for batteries and wiring!](https://preview.redd.it/1aw0zf30ftvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97418be5ec2661541ce79e05539963054cb1490a)\n\n# Silver’s Role in the Future of Technology\n\nOne cannot overstate the importance of silver in the global economy’s technological evolution. Half of the demand for silver comes from industrial uses, which continue to grow as the world moves toward greater electrification and automation. From renewable energy sources like solar panels to advanced medical technologies, silver is at the heart of modern innovation.\n\nHowever, even as silver becomes increasingly critical, recycling efforts are not sufficient to close the supply gap. Darshana Thacker, Global Business Manager at Ames Goldsmith Corporation, pointed out that while silver is used in many electronic devices, it is often mixed with other components, making it difficult to recover. Even if recycling doubled its output, it would not be enough to meet the rising demand.\n\n# The Investment Landscape for Silver\n\nWhile silver’s industrial demand is surging, investment demand remains robust. Investors recognize silver’s role as both a store of value and a key industrial commodity, creating a dual demand that will continue to support prices. According to a survey conducted at the 2024 LBMA Precious Metals Conference, delegates expect silver prices to rise to $45 an ounce—more than a 40% increase from current levels.\n\nAs Danielle Oliari of CNT Depository explained, investment demand could spike further as industrial buyers compete with retail investors for the same pool of silver. This competition will inevitably push prices higher, especially as silver becomes scarcer.\n\n[Bright Future for Silver!](https://preview.redd.it/3a6bekaoftvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dec4db67362d5eb50b49b4a069c96702ff28de1)\n\n# Silver’s Bright Future\n\nFor investors looking for a stable yet dynamic asset, silver presents an unparalleled opportunity. Its fundamental role in the global economy, coupled with an insurmountable supply deficit, makes it one of the most attractive investments of 2024. Whether you’re looking for a hedge against inflation or a piece of the future technological landscape, silver is the smart choice. As we face a world increasingly dependent on silver’s unique properties, the market will only become tighter, and prices will rise accordingly.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1729388552.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g7o2xg/silver_the_ultimate_investment_amid_a_looming/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g7o2xg/silver_the_ultimate_investment_amid_a_looming/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1g724ur", "title": "BlackRock Eyes BUIDL for Derivatives Collateral: A Step Forward or Ethical Minefield?", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "In a move that’s set to shake up the world of cryptocurrency derivatives, asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly pushing its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) token to be used as collateral on major crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit. With the support of Securitize, this initiative could position BUIDL as a direct competitor to existing stablecoins like Tether’s USdT, especially in the high-stakes world of derivatives trading, which now makes up over 70% of the total crypto market volume.\n\nOn the surface, this sounds like a savvy move for BlackRock—leveraging its formidable institutional credibility to expand into one of the fastest-growing segments of financial markets. But while this seems like a strategic masterstroke, it raises important questions about the ethical implications of such a move.\n\n[More Than Just Another Token?](https://preview.redd.it/2dreoiyzdnvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d4662e5406bd5eb1fedbc07d67d025b469eae12)\n\n# The Opportunity: More Than Just Another Token\n\nLet’s get this straight—BUIDL isn’t just another flashy cryptocurrency. Backed by traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries and cash, and supported by the heavyweight of institutional finance that is BlackRock, this token is designed to bring more trust, stability, and liquidity to crypto derivatives trading. With a minimum investment threshold of $5 million, it’s not designed for the everyday retail investor; this is strictly for institutional players who can make or break markets.\n\nWhat makes this move particularly interesting is its timing. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently took a significant step toward integrating digital assets as collateral for traditional derivatives trading, signaling that regulators are increasingly accepting the merger of traditional and crypto markets. Should this proposal go through, it would be a game-changer for institutional players like BlackRock, who would now have a clear path to bridge the gap between these two financial worlds.\n\nIf BUIDL becomes a staple collateral asset, BlackRock could effectively create a new layer of financial infrastructure, replacing or rivaling the role that stablecoins currently play in the derivatives ecosystem. With $3 trillion in crypto derivatives contracts traded on centralized exchanges in September alone, that’s a lot of market share to tap into.\n\n[Have Regular People Been Failed?](https://preview.redd.it/fp2xi3fnenvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6afa14e7c0cc3574b4063c261e230d5d9210c0db)\n\n# The Risks and Ethical Concerns: Power Concentration and Transparency\n\nBut here’s where the skepticism kicks in. Is BlackRock’s move just another example of traditional finance (TradFi) attempting to dominate the rapidly democratizing world of decentralized finance (DeFi)? With BUIDL being exclusively available to institutional investors, it seems like this initiative caters to the very same elite class of players that many in the crypto space have fought to move away from. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in assets under management, stepping in to assert its dominance in this new frontier feels a bit like the fox guarding the henhouse.\n\nSure, BUIDL offers stability and trust, but is that what the crypto world really needs—or wants? Crypto was designed to be an open, decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems that have repeatedly failed regular people. By offering a token that only institutions can buy into, BlackRock is essentially reinforcing the same old power dynamics. It’s hard to ignore the ethical dilemma this creates. Does this move align with the democratizing ethos of crypto? It feels more like an opportunistic power grab.\n\nThere’s also the question of transparency. Unlike decentralized stablecoins or other assets that thrive on open-source code and public accountability, BUIDL is squarely in the hands of BlackRock and its institutional investors. This creates a potential choke point in the market. What happens when BlackRock holds too much sway in how collateral operates across multiple crypto exchanges? Will this lead to another layer of centralization in a space that was supposed to decentralize power?\n\n[\\\\\"Experience the power of precision mining with Kuya Silver, setting new standards in the silver industry.\\\\\" \\(CSE: KUYA | OTCQB: KUYAF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/op8yp0uqenvd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96695a978f83ca57c530092561c1d4014dbac340)\n\n# BUIDL vs. Stablecoins: A Battle for Market Dominance\n\nThe battle between BUIDL and stablecoins like Tether’s USdT is essentially a tug-of-war for market dominance in the crypto derivatives space. Tether, with all its controversies, has been a dominant player for years. But it operates in a much more open and accessible environment. BUIDL, on the other hand, is a walled garden—restricted to institutional investors and tied to the deep pockets of BlackRock.\n\nThere’s also the issue of scale. While BUIDL has a market cap of $547.7 million as of October 18, that’s dwarfed by Tether’s total market cap, which sits well over $80 billion. But size isn’t everything. BUIDL’s integration into some of the largest crypto exchanges could give it a first-mover advantage in the institutional space, provided BlackRock can build enough trust in its new collateral system.\n\n[BlackRock Takes Over... Again](https://preview.redd.it/gi1kr990fnvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10bf853fe6f1dae8bdf310014d65c046554dc156)\n\n# A New Era or a Step Backward?\n\nBlackRock’s push to bring BUIDL into the crypto derivatives market is undeniably a smart business move. It leverages the firm’s institutional clout and plays into a rapidly growing sector of the market. But it also brings into question the ethical ramifications of such a maneuver. Should crypto—born from ideals of decentralization and democratization—be dominated by a single player with trillions in traditional assets under management?\n\nThis move feels less like innovation and more like colonization of the decentralized space by a centralized behemoth. It’s time for the crypto community and regulators to think critically about whether they want BlackRock to have such outsized influence. And while BUIDL might be an excellent product for institutions, it seems like it’s furthering a trend that crypto was supposed to fight against. Keep an eye on this one—it’s going to shape the future of finance, for better or for worse.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1729316150.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g724ur/blackrock_eyes_buidl_for_derivatives_collateral_a/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g724ur/blackrock_eyes_buidl_for_derivatives_collateral_a/", "subreddit": "investment"}

In a bold new move, Intel is reportedly seeking to sell a minority stake in its Altera business, a unit it purchased in 2015 for $16.7 billion. This transaction could generate billions in much-needed capital, allowing Intel to reposition itself in an increasingly competitive market. The deal would value Altera at approximately $17 billion, marking a strategic shift in Intel’s game plan. While Intel has previously touted Altera as a cornerstone of its future ambitions, the company's changing financial landscape has led it to consider new approaches for maintaining its standing in the tech world.\n\n[Intel Needs Capital](https://preview.redd.it/279qxqqx3nvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83cff0eb33f1fced216c996bae385ca1a1b6c916)\n\n# The Need for Capital: Intel’s Struggle for Market Share\n\nIntel’s motivations for selling part of its Altera unit are clear when considering its current market struggles. The company has faced a staggering 50% decline in its stock price this year, driven largely by the erosion of its market share in key sectors. Intel has been outpaced by competitors like Nvidia in artificial intelligence (AI) chips and has lost ground to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in its core markets for PC processors and data center chips.\n\nThis steep decline is symptomatic of a larger problem: Intel has failed to maintain the dominance it once had in the semiconductor industry. While it is still a formidable player, Intel is no longer the unchallenged leader it once was. Companies like Nvidia and AMD have surged ahead, thanks to their superior innovation and faster execution in emerging tech sectors, such as AI and high-performance computing.\n\nThe sale of a stake in Altera would provide Intel with the financial firepower it needs to continue pursuing its ambitions in semiconductor fabrication, a field where it has been increasingly outclassed. By generating billions in cash through this transaction, Intel would have the flexibility to invest in new manufacturing technologies, which are essential for regaining its competitive edge.\n\n# Why Sell Altera Now?\n\nIntel’s acquisition of Altera in 2015 was a calculated move. Altera, a leading provider of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), offered Intel a way to diversify its product offerings and penetrate markets beyond traditional CPUs. FPGAs are specialized chips used in data centers, telecommunications, and a variety of other applications, making them a valuable addition to Intel’s portfolio. At the time, Intel viewed the Altera acquisition as a key element in its strategy to dominate new markets, especially in cloud computing and communications infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the situation today is markedly different. While Altera remains a valuable business, Intel’s broader challenges have forced the company to reassess its priorities. The potential sale of a minority stake in Altera is not an abandonment of the business, but rather a pragmatic decision to unlock capital that Intel desperately needs. This move signals that Intel is serious about its commitment to revitalizing its semiconductor operations, even if it means temporarily stepping back from certain ventures.\n\nIn fact, selling a portion of Altera could accelerate Intel’s longer-term strategy. The company has previously floated the idea of taking Altera public through an initial public offering (IPO) by 2026. However, selling a stake to private equity or strategic investors could achieve this monetization goal more quickly, while also providing Intel with strategic partners who may contribute to its future growth.\n\n[Leadership in Semiconductor Fabrication?](https://preview.redd.it/yqa3yru14nvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ed98b5c9c7b6b1263cfc7fcefaf6bfe1e00a9f)\n\n# Intel’s Semiconductor Fabrication Ambitions\n\nAt the heart of Intel’s current strategy is its desire to regain leadership in semiconductor fabrication, the actual manufacturing of chips. Over the past several years, Intel has struggled to keep pace with competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung, both of which have established themselves as leaders in advanced chip production. Intel’s ambition is to once again be a dominant force in this space, but doing so requires significant investment in new facilities and technology.\n\nBy selling a stake in Altera, Intel would have the capital it needs to fund these endeavors. CEO Pat Gelsinger has been vocal about Intel’s commitment to building state-of-the-art fabrication plants, and this transaction would allow the company to follow through on that commitment. The infusion of cash would help Intel to innovate, scale its production capacity, and potentially take advantage of government subsidies that are becoming available in key markets, such as the U.S. and Europe, which are keen to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\n\n[\\\\\"Discover the brilliance of sustainable mining with Andean Precious Metals, your gateway to ethical silver and gold production.\\\\\" \\(TSX-V: APM | OTCQX: ANPMF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kyjw77244nvd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db1bf231837c096fa6e446785395235ba2b1af9e)\n\n# The Qualcomm Factor and Regulatory Hurdles\n\nAdding complexity to Intel’s situation is the fact that Qualcomm has reportedly expressed interest in acquiring a stake in Altera or possibly even Intel itself. Such a deal would have massive implications for the semiconductor industry, given Qualcomm’s position as a major player in mobile and communications chips. However, any such acquisition would undoubtedly face significant regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. and other governments are increasingly wary of consolidation in the semiconductor space, given the strategic importance of the industry to national security.\n\nA Qualcomm-Intel deal could reshape the competitive landscape, but it could also be fraught with challenges, including antitrust concerns and geopolitical tensions. Therefore, Intel’s decision to seek private equity or strategic investment in Altera, rather than a full sale to a competitor, may be a more palatable option from both a regulatory and strategic standpoint.\n\n[Critical Turning Point?](https://preview.redd.it/1st4vmu94nvd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ef1e00181627b1b423cde98e4b26ccd6fdc2797)\n\n# Intel’s Path Forward\n\nIntel’s potential sale of a stake in Altera represents a critical turning point for the company. While it reflects the pressures Intel is currently facing, it also demonstrates the company’s willingness to take bold actions to secure its future. The funds generated from this transaction would provide Intel with the flexibility it needs to invest in semiconductor fabrication, revamp its competitive position, and reassure investors that it is capable of making a comeback.\n\nHowever, this is only one step in a much longer journey. For Intel to reclaim its position as a leader in the semiconductor industry, it must continue to innovate, execute with precision, and make strategic decisions that align with long-term industry trends.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1729312024.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g713o0/intels_strategic_move_selling_a_stake_in_altera/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g713o0/intels_strategic_move_selling_a_stake_in_altera/", "subreddit": "investment"}

{"id": "1g4ofhr", "title": "ASML Faces Mounting Pressure Amid Weaker China Sales: A Geopolitical and Market Setback", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "ASML, one of the world’s leading suppliers of advanced semiconductor equipment, recently faced a significant blow in the market, as its shares plunged by 16% following a disappointing sales forecast. This downturn is not just a reflection of the company’s financial performance but also a symptom of the growing geopolitical and market challenges that have come to define its operations. The primary concern is ASML’s business dealings with China, a market that has historically been a cornerstone of the company's success. However, recent developments—driven by new export restrictions from both the U.S. and the Netherlands—threaten to upend the trajectory of this crucial market for ASML.\n\n[WEAK SALES PROJECTIONS](https://preview.redd.it/jh0lluqwx0vd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d536194c417b6baaf3f2f26f7f7272d99d3f2330)\n\n# The Impact of Weaker Sales Projections\n\nThe Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, issued its financial results ahead of schedule, a move prompted by a technical error. While the report’s premature release was an unfortunate mistake, it highlighted a worrying trend for ASML. For 2025, ASML now expects net sales to fall between **30 billion euros and 35 billion euros** ($32.7 billion to $38.1 billion)—significantly lower than previously projected. This adjustment has cast a long shadow over its short-term outlook.\n\nThe reduced sales projections are due, in part, to **weaker-than-expected demand from China**—a market that has been instrumental in ASML’s growth. The company's net bookings for the September quarter amounted to **2.6 billion euros**, a staggering **50% shortfall** from the consensus estimate of 5.6 billion euros. Despite this, ASML’s **net sales** of **7.5 billion euros** surpassed expectations, signaling that some areas of the business are still holding strong. Yet, the bigger issue remains: **China’s contribution to the company’s overall revenue is dwindling, and the global market’s recovery is slower than anticipated**.\n\n[ASML's Chinese Revenue Dwindles](https://preview.redd.it/lo1hhahix0vd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19bce803a44ce0abb0d311596a37935b4aaa1d76)\n\n# Geopolitical Headwinds: The Chinese Dilemma\n\nAt the heart of ASML’s recent struggles lies the increasingly strained relationship between China and the U.S., with the Netherlands caught in the middle. ASML’s **Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines**—used to manufacture the most advanced microchips—are integral to China’s semiconductor ambitions. These machines are used by global giants like **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** and **Nvidia** to produce chips that power everything from smartphones to AI systems.\n\nHowever, **U.S. export controls**, combined with restrictions from the Dutch government, are severely limiting ASML’s ability to sell its equipment to Chinese firms. **U.S. restrictions**, which were tightened last month, now block the export of critical chipmaking technology, including the EUV machines, to China. Meanwhile, the **Dutch government**, under pressure from its Western allies, has enacted its own measures, further limiting ASML’s access to this key market.\n\nChina has long been a **dominant source of revenue** for ASML. In fact, during certain periods, China accounted for nearly **half of the company’s total sales**. The shift in ASML’s business outlook reflects the undeniable truth: **China’s contribution to the company’s bottom line is now in decline, and this is not a temporary situation**.\n\n[\\\\\"Normalized\\\\\" China Business ](https://preview.redd.it/vxfebhoyx0vd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e310feb4fffcee836a3d8256b236c42fb07d6d26)\n\n# ASML’s Response: A “Normalized” China Business\n\nASML's CFO, **Roger Dassen**, addressed this shift, suggesting that the company is now preparing for **China to account for only around 20%** of total revenue in the coming year. This is a stark contrast to previous earnings reports, where China represented as much as **49% of ASML's sales**. Dassen emphasized that this decline is not a sudden blow but rather a return to “historically normal percentages.” Nonetheless, the reality is clear: **ASML’s business in China is no longer the powerhouse it once was**, and the geopolitical situation has altered the trajectory of its growth.\n\nThe loss of China as a dominant force in ASML’s financial picture has significant implications not just for the company but for the entire semiconductor industry. ASML’s role in the global supply chain for cutting-edge chips is critical, and as **China’s access to EUV technology is throttled**, it will face an increasingly difficult path toward achieving its long-term semiconductor ambitions. For ASML, the question is whether it can make up for this lost revenue by expanding into other regions or tapping into new technological markets.\n\n[\\\\\"Discover high-grade gold opportunities with West Red Lake Gold Mines, your partner in precious metal exploration.\\\\\" \\(TSXV: WRLG | OTCQB: WRLGF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6l9flcemx0vd1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13a59d2fa659b575a51629e4f552ac59c90d4a6d)\n\n# Analysts’ Reactions: A Bleak Outlook\n\nThe market’s reaction to ASML’s earnings release has been overwhelmingly negative. **Bernstein analysts** noted that the company’s **weaker-than-expected order book** and the **disappointing outlook for 2025** will likely overshadow what they considered to be decent Q3 results. ASML's lowered guidance points to a **delayed recovery** in the semiconductor market, as demand for chips from industries outside of AI and high-performance computing has taken longer to pick up than previously expected.\n\nMeanwhile, **Cantor analysts** described the outlook as “**clearly disappointing**,” and they warned that this will put pressure on the broader semiconductor market. **Semiconductor stocks**—already under pressure from a sluggish global recovery—took a hit as a result of ASML’s poor performance. Still, they emphasized that ASML's outlook does not signal a slowdown in the broader **AI growth story**, which remains a key driver of innovation and demand for advanced chips.\n\n[Future of ASML...](https://preview.redd.it/j608b3opx0vd1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8875245e33ffa71f3c656b558a3e19da67382a2d)\n\n# Looking Ahead: ASML’s Path Forward\n\nASML finds itself at a crossroads. The **global semiconductor market** is poised for growth, particularly driven by the demand for chips that power artificial intelligence, data centers, and next-generation technologies. However, the **political risks** surrounding ASML’s exposure to China—combined with the broader economic uncertainty—pose serious challenges for the company.\n\nIn the coming months, ASML must focus on recalibrating its business strategy. **Diversification of markets** will be key, particularly as the company attempts to make up for lost sales in China. Additionally, ASML’s deep reliance on its **advanced technology** must be matched by efforts to protect its intellectual property and ensure that its equipment remains in high demand globally, even in the face of geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe road ahead is uncertain, but one thing is clear: **ASML’s ability to adapt to shifting global dynamics will determine its future success**. Whether it can navigate the complexities of the semiconductor industry and the changing geopolitical landscape remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that **ASML’s path forward will be shaped by forces far beyond its control**, as the battle over access to advanced semiconductor technology rages on.\n\n# ASML’s Response: A “Normalized” China Business", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1729043626.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g4ofhr/asml_faces_mounting_pressure_amid_weaker_china/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g4ofhr/asml_faces_mounting_pressure_amid_weaker_china/", "subreddit": "investment"}
{"id": "1g3xwt0", "title": "The Allure of Nvidia: A Sinful Temptation in the AI Gold Rush", "author": "WeekendJail", "text": "In today’s world, where technological advancements move at a blistering pace, there are few companies as emblematic of this progress as Nvidia. Its meteoric rise in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry has captured the attention of investors and corporations alike. On Monday, Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of $138.07, reflecting a 2.4% increase. These numbers are extraordinary, with the company’s shares soaring almost 180% in 2024 alone, and up over nine-fold since the beginning of 2023. But we must ask ourselves: at what cost?\n\nNvidia’s dominance in the AI sector is undeniable. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and corporations such as Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are buying these GPUs in massive quantities. Yet, there is a deeper, more troubling issue at play here, one that transcends the superficial allure of financial success.\n\nThe company’s very name, **Nvidia**, is derived from the Latin word \"invidia,\" meaning **envy**—one of the seven deadly sins. And herein lies a moral conflict that should give us pause. Envy is a dangerous force, a poison that corrupts the soul and clouds judgment. Those who indulge in it risk damnation, for the sin of envy is not simply a personal failing, but a transgression that leads us away from righteousness and into the depths of greed and moral decay. If you buy into Nvidia’s success, you are buying into more than just stock—you are buying into a sin, a path that leads not to salvation, but to eternal ruin.\n\n[Nvidia is the road to Hell.](https://preview.redd.it/hzw3o7102uud1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c10e538ae466a8f1ac5b6e06930ebbf4e713fdf)\n\n# The Temptation of Wealth and Power\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why Nvidia has become such a tempting prospect for investors. The company is riding high on the so-called \"AI gold rush,\" where its GPUs are seen as the essential tools—like the picks and shovels of old—that enable the creation and deployment of advanced AI models. Nvidia holds an astounding 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, making it the uncontested leader in this field. Wall Street, ever the insatiable beast, has been quick to capitalize on this dominance, and Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in the past five consecutive quarters.\n\nThis, however, is where the danger lies. The greed that fuels the stock market’s obsession with Nvidia mirrors the sin of envy that the company itself embodies. As investors, technologists, and corporations scramble to be part of this AI revolution, they do so not out of a desire to better humanity, but out of a base, selfish urge to amass wealth and power. They are not content with what they have—they want more, always more, and they see Nvidia as the gateway to their unholy desires.\n\nConsider the broader implications of this AI boom. Nvidia’s GPUs power systems that shape the future of human interaction, labor, and even creativity. While AI holds great potential for progress, we must be mindful of how this technology is being used. The mass deployment of AI systems raises ethical concerns around privacy, the automation of jobs, and the centralization of power in the hands of a few tech giants. It is no coincidence that the very corporations pouring billions into Nvidia—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon—are the same companies that have come under scrutiny for their monopolistic practices and disregard for the well-being of the average person.\n\n[ A FALSE IDOL \\(IN HELL\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gddmmh7v2uud1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0201b7d221e4e6b0d3251fa3cdf86a5f1cf8fb1f)\n\n# Nvidia: A False Idol\n\nLet us be clear: Nvidia is not just another company enjoying a streak of good fortune. Its rapid ascent to a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, second only to Apple, is a reflection of a society that has lost its way. Nvidia has become a false idol, worshipped by those who have succumbed to the sin of envy. People look to it not for wisdom or enlightenment, but for profit and power. In this sense, Nvidia represents everything that is wrong with the modern world—a world that prioritizes material gain over spiritual fulfillment, a world that values envy over humility.\n\nThe Bible warns us about the consequences of envy, as it is a sin that leads us away from God. In Proverbs 14:30, it is written: *\"A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.\"* This is not a metaphor to be taken lightly. Those who chase after Nvidia’s wealth, who covet its success, are not merely risking their financial stability; they are risking their very souls. To indulge in this sin is to invite spiritual decay, a rot that will consume you from the inside out.\n\n[Discover the brilliance of sustainable mining with Aya Gold &amp; Silver, where innovation meets responsibility. \\(TSX: AYA | OTCQX: AYASF\\)](https://preview.redd.it/57tyomk03uud1.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2cbe016c04fbe5b2b4fd37ed2ae071c4022f769)\n\n# A Call to Reject Sinful Temptation\n\nThe time has come for us to reflect on the moral implications of our actions. The pursuit of wealth, at the expense of virtue, is a dangerous road, one that leads to eternal suffering. Nvidia, with its foundation rooted in envy, offers nothing but false promises. Its success is a mirage, tempting you to stray from the path of righteousness and into the fires of greed and damnation.\n\nReject Nvidia. Reject envy. Embrace humility and righteousness. For in doing so, you protect not only your material well-being but also your soul from the eternal fires of hell. In a world obsessed with artificial intelligence and technological power, remember that true power lies not in machines, but in the purity of the human spirit. To forsake envy is to embrace the path of salvation, and to find peace in the knowledge that what is righteous will endure, long after Nvidia's moment of sinful glory has passed into oblivion.\n\n[REJECT SIN](https://preview.redd.it/7ch26qlb3uud1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=019e897ed037fe5a6c53dc1c9b218d337ad09ccb)\n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1728960628.0, "permalink": "/r/investment/comments/1g3xwt0/the_allure_of_nvidia_a_sinful_temptation_in_the/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investment/comments/1g3xwt0/the_allure_of_nvidia_a_sinful_temptation_in_the/", "subreddit": "investment"}

Despite its rarity, platinum's price hasn't seen the same surge as gold. Why? Well, platinum's demand is closely tied to industrial use, particularly in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Unlike gold, which is seen primarily as a store of value, platinum's price is more sensitive to shifts in these industries.\n\nHowever, this could be a hidden gem for investors. Since platinum hasn't skyrocketed like gold, it might be undervalued right now. If industrial demand picks up or if more investors start recognizing its rarity, platinum prices could see significant growth. Of course, no investment is without risk. Platinum's market can be volatile, and fluctuations in industrial demand could impact prices.\n\nHere's a quick comparison of historical price trends between gold and platinum.  \n🔵GOLD 🟠SILVER 🟢PLATINUM\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbpzndwfn0id1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=defd8b4d0ad411153d475d14671dfdcb415c6bf4\n\nSo, what do you think?

{"id": "1kj5itp", "title": "[POST-EARNINGS FOLLOW-UP] HIMS – GLP-1 Timing Hit, Robinhood Fumbled, and This Was Never a Gamble", "author": "Disastrous-Coat3057", "text": "Original DD: [Earnings Play on HIMS – GLP-1 Expansion Timing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kd1o43/earnings_play_on_hims_glp1_expansion_timing/)\n\nAfter earnings, HIMS popped, stalled, then ripped again. In the middle of that, Robinhood quietly reclassified the results from a beat to a miss with no explanation. The actual EPS didn’t change, but the prediction did...that was bizaare to say the least. That move likely shook out some momentum traders, but it also probably incentivized those with shorts to cover their position and the core of the trade played out exactly as laid out.\n\n**What We Got Right:**\n\n* **GLP-1 rollout timing:** Management confirmed GLP-1 expansion is coming in the second half of the year. That was the central thesis. It hit.\n* **Narrative gap:** The street was still pricing HIMS like a gimmick. Fundamentals were stronger than sentiment reflected and that dislocation created the edge.\n* **Novo Nordisk partnership:** The market hadn’t priced in a legitimate relationship with Novo Nordisk. That’s a signal of operational credibility. It changes the long-term risk profile.\n* **Delayed continuation:** Price action didn’t fully react until the day after earnings and things were looking weird overnight. That delay reinforced the view that this was a misunderstood setup, not a crowded one.\n\n**What We Missed:**\n\n* **Compounding uncertainty:** We didn’t fully account for how regulatory headlines around compounded GLP-1s might weigh on sentiment. That was a risk that deserved more weight.\n* **Robinhood’s walk-back:** A last-minute classification change from a major platform like Robinhood shouldn’t matter, but I think it did. Not sure if other platforms retroactively changed their EPS predictions.  Several people reached out to me concerned that it had missed, only to realize minutes later that it didn't.  Some institutions were predicting EPS at .23, including Robinhood, but the .14 predicted EPS that they reverted to and was held by many other institutions won the day, making this a beat.\n\n**This Was Not a Gamble**\n\nThere was risk, but this was never YOLO. This was a structured asymmetric trade with a defined catalyst window, options mispricing, and a clear narrative pivot. That’s the whole game.\n\nThe market is still digesting what HIMS is becoming. We were ahead of that. And we’ll be ready again when the next setup hits.  If you've made it this far, I'm sure you're wondering why my balance is $29.74...I'm switching to Thinkorswim.  Robinhood is a smooth platform to use, but I think TOS is going to be better for me in trying to line up trades like this.

Free Money?", "author": "longbull98", "text": "SPY’s been ripping lately from its lows on “trade deals” and general hopium. Latest one? UK. media made it seem like a big deal, but that’s not moving markets. Plus, that's an ally. Easier to get a trade deal done there than with other trading partners.\n\nChina is the main one that matters. And I don't think we’re anywhere close.\n\nMarkets have been pumping on this weekend's meeting with China, and this is how I think the news will go on Monday: Trump says, “The deal went great.” — Xi comes out a day later and says, “We're not even close.”  \n\nAll in all, the leading player who's been flinching and going back on their word is the orange man and his crew. XI's been set in stone, while Trump's flinching with either bond yields rising, markets collapsing, negative remarks from big Wall Street players, etc, etc..\n\nMost Recent Trump talks tough (145% tariffs), then backs off (80%), then says they’re negotiating (BTW 145% and 80% is the same thing in terms of trade - people are importing anything with either). This cycle’s been repeating. Xi isn’t blinking. We are.\n\nSo here’s what I did:\n\n* **Sold 300 SPY 605C 9/30/25 @ 10.74**\n* **Bought 300 SPY 615C 9/30/25 @ 7.49**\n\nTotal credit: **$3.25 or $97,500**\n\nSPY’s at **564**\n\nBreak-even at **608.25** → That’s a **7.8% move up**\n\nMax loss if SPY rips above **615 around a 9% move up**\n\n# Thesis:\n\n* Trade deal with China breaks down (again) next week\n* No way we rally another 8–10% with macro headwinds\n* Market already priced in “good outcome,” there’s too much downside from here\n* We don’t touch February’s high again anytime soon\n\n**Risk:**\n\n* CPI tanks → Fed starts signaling cuts\n* Tech earnings beat hard\n* Or Xi caves (not likely)\n\nIf we go higher and break SPY ATH, im cooked. But I like the odds. Ill take a 2 to 1 risk reqard any day of the week.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCharged $3.25 for 300x bear call spread.\n\nSPY needs to break ATH for me to get burnt. Way to many hurdles in its path, main one being a China deal.\n\nIf we chop or fade on another China fake-out, I’m walking with 6 figures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/879v2ngwntze1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e1aeb46297069f64bd15ec0eba5508f8abb2079\n\n", "score": 140, "num_comments": 90, "created_utc": 1746825160.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kithya/300x_spy_bear_call_spread_into_the_trade_deal/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kithya/300x_spy_bear_call_spread_into_the_trade_deal/", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets"}

If stock prices remain stable, the positive carry benefits from compounding returns over a 5–10-year investment horizon. This strategy also offers potential for stock price growth and a more tax-efficient return of capital. With a positive carry, any cost basis increase is profit.\n\n# Robinhood Margin:\n\n**Historical Borrowing Rates**\n\nRobinhood’s margin interest rate is calculated by adding the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Rate to their interest rate, which varies depending on your settled margin account balance, resulting in the rates shown in the table below (Margin Interest Rates)\n\n[Margin Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/265uq9jeamze1.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc1061142214109921bb1f58ed0e128648de51e8)\n\nBusiness Development Companies (BDCs), such as Main Street Capital (MAIN), can benefit from higher interest income from floating-rate loans; however, rising rates may also increase default risks for their borrowers, leading to higher debt servicing costs.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are more negatively affected by interest rate increases due to higher debt costs, competition with bonds, and potential decreases in property values.\n\n**Margin Rates**\n\nMargin rate quotes for $575,000 borrowed:\n\n5.15% - WeBull Premium ($40 /yr)  \n**5.25% - Robinhood Gold ($50 /yr)**  \n5.33% - Interactive Brokers Pro (Commission based trades)  \n6.25% - M1 Finance  \n8.25% - Ally Invest  \n8.50% - Fidelity  \n10.70% - E\\*TRADE  \n10.77% - Charles Schwab  \n\\~8-15% - Personal Loans (Max \\~100k)  \nPrime + 2% - 401k Loan (Max 50% of 401k portfolio)\n\n[Robinhood margin interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/jjltpwzramze1.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df882173212317a4428d6122c784725dd73c9763)\n\n \n\n**Margin and Maintenance**\n\nAfter the early successes with Main Street Capital’s play, I began leveraging more and more Chez, which eventually added up to $575,000 in leverage, resulting in a monthly cost of \\~$2500 or $30,000 yearly.\n\n[“They mistook leverage for genius” – Steve Eisman \\(Mark Baum in The Big Short\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3iz0chd6bmze1.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=923eb0cbba3b60fce87223f0dce7b9b9f9cdfd4d)\n\n(-$68,931) Margin Costs + Robinhood Gold ($50/yr.) Since Account Inception\n\nMost of my holdings follow these margin maintenance requirements\n\n50% - Initial Requirement  \n25% - Maintenance Requirement            \n\nRH has yet to publish any official information on how these maintenance requirements are determined, but customer support stated that they are mainly based on volatility.    \n\n# Proof of Concept:\n\n**Main Street Capital (MAIN)**\n\nMain Street Capital Corporation (MAIN) is a business development company (BDC) that primarily provides debt and equity capital to small and medium businesses with market caps between $10 million and $300 million.\n\nMAIN is a middle-ground financing option for businesses that are too big for a local bank but too small to consider an IPO.\n\nMAIN’s yield on Cost of 13% helped me weather the storm of high-margin interest rates.  \nI chose this fund primarily due to its monthly dividend and its status as one of the best BDCs on the market.\n\n[https:\\/\\/trackyourdividends.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/r01aexpobmze1.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f2a6abf0cd82df8e869da3390f410fc1be6b14)\n\n**Is MAIN** ***still*** **a good investment?

A total margin position of $53,697, at 5.25%, costs me $2,819 a year to hold. So, I think I'll wait for a recovery.\n\n# PROs and CONs of this Positive Carry Strategy:\n\n**PROs**  \n\\-With a positive carry, time is on my side.  \n\\-Federal interest rate cuts are expected, resulting in reduced margin costs.  \n\\-Using leverage for faster-outsized returns during bull markets.\n\n**CONs**  \n\\-Large Tax Bill – Current rate 24%  \n\\-Non-qualified Distributions for most fixed-income payers.\n\n\\-Regulated Investment Companies (RICs) are investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and BDCs, that are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders to avoid being taxed at the corporate level. Distributions are classified as ordinary income.\n\n\\-In January 2021, Robinhood discontinued trading on Closed-End Funds (CEFs) and a few other investment vehicles due to low trading volume. Currently, I have 34 restricted holdings\n\n\\-Even investing in the S&amp;P 500 with leverage would be outside the scope of this strategy, as the \\~2% dividend would not constitute a positive carry.  \n\n# “Risk Management”:\n\nThe federal statutes in Title 15 of the U.S. Code govern commerce and trade. Within that, chapter 2D focuses on investment companies and advisers. Under 2D, the Investment Company Act of 1940 Section 18(a)(1) is a specific law governing investment companies' regulation.\n\nClosed-end investment companies must maintain an asset coverage ratio of:\n\n3:1 (300%) for senior debt securities  \n2:1 (200%) for preferred stock\n\nA report from the Investment Company Institute shows that, as of year-end 2023, at least 249 traditional funds—62 percent of the total—were using leverage. [https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs\\_closed\\_end](https://www.ici.org/faqs/faqs_closed_end)\n\nI initiated this strategy in March 2020, and 2022 marked the worst calendar-year loss for the broad U.S. bond market since the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index records began in 1976. And my margin buffer was enough to stay well clear of a margin call.\n\nTo put it another way, I’m aware that I'm using leverage to buy leveraged assets. However, I plan to keep utilizing the margin up to the 30% buffer.\n\n[More Margin, Fewer Problems](https://preview.redd.it/0iwzf79temze1.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fdaa1697bd4728fceb7ab14529e43c149f5601a)\n\n# My next strategy:\n\nThe current portfolio has 260 unique holdings\n\nOnly 69 holdings have 100 shares or more\n\n32 restricted to sell only by Robinhood\n\nI realize options are much more lucrative, but this is free money.\n\nI plan to consolidate some of my holdings to reach 100 shares, which will enable me to write covered calls.\n\nHow remedial is this positive carry strategy?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1746738609.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ki1ck0/positive_carry_investing_with_robinhood_margin/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ki1ck0/positive_carry_investing_with_robinhood_margin/", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets"}

My thesis is based on a few key factors:\n\nPre-Earnings Run-Up: AFRM has seen a notable run-up ahead of earnings, which often signals a \"buy the rumor\" dynamic. Historically, the stock tends to pull back slightly after earnings—regardless of the results—which supports a cautious short-term outlook.\n\nEarnings Expectations: While I do expect Affirm to report solid earnings, the recent rally appears to have already priced in a lot of optimism. This sets the stage for a potential “sell the news” reaction.\n\nStrike Selection and Price Target: I'm placing spreads around the $52 level, which I estimate to be a reasonable pullback zone post-earnings. It represents a balance between the current elevated price and historical reaction patterns.\n\nOption Pricing and Volatility: The implied volatility (rather than delta—though both are relevant) is extremely high going into earnings, inflating premiums. This benefits the spread structure I’m using. The options for the May 9 expiry are priced so attractively that, even if the stock moves ±10%, the spread could still return a profit due to favorable pricing and volatility crush post-earnings.\n\nThe risk to reward here feels just right for me 🤞", "score": 20, "num_comments": 55, "created_utc": 1746727783.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1khwxtw/putting_80k_on_afrm_spreads/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khwxtw", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets"}

Uber's revenues fell in the last earnings, but profitability was way up. If they acquire Instacart, their revenues shoot up, plus they acquire a profitable business.\n5.

My personal opinion is that google searches on Safari decreased because people default away from Safari. It’s a SAFARI problem, not a google search problem. Anyhow, of course, however, the pundits on CNBC and elsewhere are quick to come on and talk about Google’s impending end. And then, of course, like clockwork, a lot of people get on Reddit and give us their anecdotal experiences how search quality via Google has drastically fallen in their minds, and now they only use ChatGPT etc etc etc.\n\nA couple of important points:\n\n- In case you didn’t already know, Google gets 5 TRILLION search queries a year. That’s right, TRILLION. ChatGPT gets a fraction of that number. \n-75% of Google searches are NOT monetized by Google. In other words, Google monetizes much less searches than it can. That means there is ALWAYS an easy way to increase revenue annually for them.\n\n- Your anecdotal experiences (“I don’t use Google anymore blah blah” is just that. I have heard for YEARS from people how “Oh Netflix has terrible shows. I canceled my subscription; Amazon delivery speed is terrible, I canceled my Prime, etc. etc.” And People invest on their own personal experience. Guess what? Google’s financials are PUBLIC. Even though ChatGPT has been out since Nov 2022, Google search queries have INCREASED. YOU may now ONLY use ChatGPT but clearly, everyone else isn’t.\n\n- The Paradox of Optionality: There are so many AI models coming out—GROK, META, Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT—that for the average lay person, optionality actually makes them paralyzed and likely to rely on what they know best: GOOGLE. \n\n- Google is the landing page. People go to google then go to ChatGPT’s site. people go to google first and type in Claude or Grok AI etc. Google is still the verb. Sure, ChatGPT has a place in the lexicon now, but when it comes to looking stuff up, GOOGLE is still the verb.\n\n-TDLR; CALLS on GOOGLE. \n", "score": 888, "num_comments": 229, "created_utc": 1746672305.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1khfq2w/as_mark_twain_once_said_the_reports_of_my_googles/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1khfq2w/as_mark_twain_once_said_the_reports_of_my_googles/", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets"}

{"id": "1kj9i5m", "title": "Tariff talks begin between US and Chinese officials in Geneva as the world looks for signs of hope", "author": "callsonreddit", "text": "GENEVA (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Secretary and America’s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world’s two biggest economies and damage the global economy.\n\nChina’s Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.\n\nDiplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn’t made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.\n\nProspects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they’ve slapped on each other’s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China [to a combined 145%](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa), and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries’ boycotting each other’s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.\n\nEven before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that “ [80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64).″\n\nSun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.\n\n“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words.”\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as [his favorite economic weapon](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-41d189bfe510e3ed7692da8647a14e64). He has, for example, [imposed a 10% tax on imports](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-stock-market-china-recession-deals-e8e54a68397e6829e1d27552a1d7bfb9) from almost every country in the world.\n\nBut the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump’s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.\n\nThose issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China’s subsidies — were left for future negotiations.\n\nBut China didn’t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.\n\nThe fight over China’s tech policy now resumes.\n\nTrump is also agitated by America’s massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.\n\nIn Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.\n\nTrump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he’s reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.\n\nThe government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.\n\n“An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland’s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,” the government said last week, adding that the executive branch “is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.”\n\nThe government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.\n\nThe United States is Switzerland’s second-biggest trading partner after the EU – a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.\n\nThe Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://apnews.com/article/china-trump-trade-tariffs-bessent-economy-71a6e410a0e5771c70ac853563a8b75d](https://apnews.com/article/china-trump-trade-tariffs-bessent-economy-71a6e410a0e5771c70ac853563a8b75d)", "score": 20, "num_comments": 21, "created_utc": 1746881306.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1kj9i5m/tariff_talks_begin_between_us_and_chinese/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kj9i5m/tariff_talks_begin_between_us_and_chinese/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}
{"id": "1kj6zki", "title": "Marky My Words: This is not just another recession… It is the beginning of a complete global breakdown.", "author": "Tripleawge", "text": "With Trump back in office imposing blanket tariffs on all U.S. trading partners, global trade is seizing up fast. Instead of boosting American industry, these tariffs act like a tax hike on consumers and businesses, while retaliation from abroad crushes U.S. exports. Don’t believe me? Look up the total net goods The US imported in Q1 and then watch what that number is in Q2… if it’s anything like the collapse of imports from China that has been steadily dropping since  end of April… \n\nMeanwhile, a 2020 style oil shock where crude prices collapse into negative territory again due to oversupply and a global demand slump is also on the cards and will decimate the energy sector. Normally cheap oil helps, but not when it bankrupts U.S. shale, kills transport jobs, and signals a collapse in real economic activity.\n\nThe Fed is cornered. Inflation metrics fall, but only because energy prices crash… not because the economy is healthy. With rising unemployment (although not rising fast enough for Fed to act in it due to Baby Boomers and Gen X retiring en masse), weak demand, and a dislocated bond market, Powell’s hands are tied. If the U.S. receives a major credit downgrade (as seems likely with exploding deficits and falling Treasury demand), long-term yields could spike even as the Fed tries to cut. Eventually, the Fed will be forced into permanent QE and yield curve control… monetizing debt just to keep the system functioning. By then, inflation returns, not from overheating, but from a collapsing dollar and evaporating trust.\n\nThis is stagflation with a geopolitical twist. China, quietly in a recession of its own, will lash out economically or militarily. BRICS nations push harder for de-dollarization. U.S. allies may begin hedging away from Washington. The result? Gold over $3,000, the S&amp;P down 50%, real GDP down 6-8%, and a long period of structural decline… where monetary policy dies, foreign capital flees, and the dollar loses its unipolar dominance.\n\nThe Fed isn’t behind the curve… they’ve lost the playbook.

The MSCI all world ex-US benchmark climbed 4 per cent in dollar terms over the same period, the biggest gap with Wall Street since 1993, when US investor enthusiasm for foreign stocks surged on the back of trade liberalisation and concerns over the domestic economy.\n\n&gt;“A large part of this underperformance is the repricing of US assets due to increased policy uncertainty and the stagflationary shock from tariffs,” said Sameer Goel, head of emerging markets and Apac research at Deutsche Bank.\n\n&gt;The tumbling greenback has helped widen the gap in performance. It has fallen by 8 per cent this year against a basket of six major currencies including the euro and yen, boosting non-US market performance in dollar terms.\n\nTwo graphs from the original article are not reproduced in the paywall-removed version.\n\nThe first graph is self-explanatory: through 16 weeks, based on the MSCI All-Country World Index ex-USA vs. MSCI USA Index, the US stocks are off to their worst start against global peers in more than 30 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h54c71hadwze1.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13931054f66f9a49b1e37c64c86204f165f18cc6\n\nThe tariff announcement put the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, Russell 2000, and the total US stock market into technical bear markets (down more than 20% from their all-time highs). Fortunately, we have recovered most of the losses due to optimism that the tariffs will be rescinded, but as seen in the second graph, the international markets have recovered much faster.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9orj6rdcdwze1.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa7a3b95a336ae3605eee2f5147e68a6c3b8e31", "score": 115, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1746857887.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1kj3m2n/financial_times_us_stocks_underperform_rest_of/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kj3m2n/financial_times_us_stocks_underperform_rest_of/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

{"id": "1kiq9q7", "title": "Trump’s Tariffs Hit US Farmers: Equipment Delays, Soaring Costs, and Brazil’s Big Win", "author": "callsonreddit", "text": "(Bloomberg) — Donald Trump’s tariffs are upending crop trading, delaying tractor purchases and constraining imports of chemical supplies into the US.\n\nThat’s the main message from big agricultural businesses as they report their quarterly earnings, giving an early glimpse into the far-reaching impacts of the US president’s trade war.\n\nThe disruptions in global trade threaten to extend a years-long slump in the US farm industry, which had already been struggling with ample supplies, depressed crop prices and rising competition from Brazil. Lack of clarity on how the Trump administration will address much-needed incentives for crop-based fuels in the next few years has added to concerns.\n\nCrop traders and processors have been among the hardest-hit. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Bunge Global SA saw their combined operating profits slump by about $750 million in the first quarter, with both companies citing an impact from trade and biofuel policy uncertainty.\n\nImporters put off purchases of US grain and oilseeds as Trump threatened tariffs as well as levies on any Chinese vessels docking at American ports, reducing trade flows, according to crop merchant The Andersons Inc.\n\n“Global trade uncertainties disrupted typical grain flows and caused many of our commercial customers to focus on just-in-time purchasing,” William Krueger, The Andersons chief executive officer, said Wednesday in a call with investors.\n\nTractor makers CNH Industrial NV and AGCO Corp. also reported lower first-quarter sales, and warned of the potential of reduced demand for farmers, which would give them less to spend on machines to plant, harvest and treat their fields. Both companies have raised prices to ease the impact of tariffs on costs.\n\n“Geopolitical uncertainties and trade frictions have dampened US farmer sentiment recently,” AGCO CEO Eric Hansotia said during a conference call with analysts. “As a result, demand for machinery was lower in the quarter than we had expected.”\n\nDuties also threaten to curb imports of some fertilizer and pesticide supplies. Shipments of phosphate — a key crop nourishing ingredient — into the US have trailed last year’s levels because vessels have been diverted to other countries to avoid the nation’s 10% tariff, Mosaic Co. said in its earnings statement.\n\n“The phosphate market remains tight, and while tariffs could disrupt trade flows, they cannot create more phosphate supply,” CEO Bruce Bodine said on a conference call with investors.\n\nFarmers are expected to pay more for pesticides as the US relies on tariff-hit countries such as China and India for some of its supplies. Nutrien Ltd. said its branded products could potentially cost as much as 7.5% more, with even higher adjustments expected for generic ingredients, as a result.\n\n“Long story short is, we’re going to see price increases,” Jeff Tarsi, Nutrien’s president of global retail, said on a Thursday call. “Our plan is to pass those price increases through to our customers.”\n\nBrazil is emerging as a winner from the trade tensions. Minerva SA said tariff turmoil drove increased Chinese demand and higher export prices for South American beef in the first quarter, helping lift profits for the Brazilian supplier. Meanwhile, China has effectively shut its market for US meat exporters including Smithfield Foods Inc.\n\nChina, the world’s largest commodity importer, has already shifted to Brazil for a meaningful part of its soybean needs since Trump first raised tariffs on goods from the Asian nation in 2018.\n\n“Any harmful impacts to the US grower profitability stemming from tariffs and trade flow shifts” are likely to benefit Brazilian growers, Jenny Wang, executive vice president of commercial at Mosaic, said in the call with analysts.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-farm-economy-starting-see-151751718.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-farm-economy-starting-see-151751718.html)\n* Paywall: [https://news.bloomberglaw.com/international-trade/us-farm-economy-is-starting-to-see-first-hits-from-trump-tariffs](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/international-trade/us-farm-economy-is-starting-to-see-first-hits-from-trump-tariffs)", "score": 573, "num_comments": 75, "created_utc": 1746816913.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1kiq9q7/trumps_tariffs_hit_us_farmers_equipment_delays/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kiq9q7/trumps_tariffs_hit_us_farmers_equipment_delays/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe group added it hopes \"this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors.\"\n\nTrump last month softened the blow of his auto tariffs by easing the impact of tariffs on parts and materials but left in place 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. He also extended a duty-free exemption for North American parts that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) rules of origin.\n\nAutomakers have hoped that Trump would ease vehicle tariffs.\n\nFord this week confirmed it hiked prices of some Mexican-built vehicles because of tariffs and said Trump's trade war would add about $2.5 billion in costs for 2025, but expects to reduce that exposure by around $1 billion.\n\nRival GM said tariffs were projected to cost it between $4 billion and $5 billion, but it expected to offset that by at least 30%, while Toyota projected tariff costs for April and May at around $1.2 billion.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-202154913.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-202154913.html)\n* Paywall: [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-uk-trade-deal-2025-05-08/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-uk-trade-deal-2025-05-08/)", "score": 2451, "num_comments": 210, "created_utc": 1746760520.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1ki8qiy/detroit_three_automakers_blast_trump_uk_trade_deal/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ki8qiy/detroit_three_automakers_blast_trump_uk_trade_deal/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

Anything else is just pure speculation.”\n\nNevertheless, “CEOs felt very reassured after Bessent’s remarks at Milken,” a source told The Post, referring to the Treasury secretary’s “sustainable” comment at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles this week. “People are realizing that deals are going to be made.”\n\nTreasury’s phone has been “blowing up” with southeast Asian nations looking to seal a deal, the source added.\n\nThe chatter in retail circles has likewise been traveling fast — and is very specific, industry sources told The Post.\n\n“We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and \\[other\\] Asian countries at 25%,” said [Lawrence Rosen,](https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/business/uss-biggest-toy-maker-cra-z-art-to-expand-domestic-factories/) chairman of Cra-Z- Art, a New Jersey-based arts-and-crafts distributor.\n\nAnother toy CEO, Nick Mowbray of Zuru – maker of Bunch O Balloons – said “The speculation is 54%,” but he added, “That’s definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”\n\nWhile sharply lower than what’s currently in effect, a 50% trade tax would pose a formidable challenge as retailers prepare for the crucial holiday season, sparking drastically higher prices at stores, retail executives said.\n\nA Tonka Mighty Dump Truck priced at $29.99 this week would cost $49.99 with a 54% tariff. While steep, that’s “workable,” according to Forman. A 145% levy, on the other hand, would translate to a $79.99 Tonka truck, which is “just too much” and would bring sales to a virtual standstill, he said.\n\nNoel Hacegaba, chief operating officer of the Port of Long Beach in California, said “there are high hopes that the meeting between the US and China in Switzerland will help to de-escalate growing trade tensions and set a path forward for resolving the trade war.”\n\nHe added, however, “it will take a strong signal coming out of the meeting for shippers to readjust their sourcing and routing.”\n\n[The toy industry is in crosshairs of the tariff wars](https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/business/us-small-businesses-tethered-to-china-sell-off-inventory-cut-jobs-amid-escalating-trade-war-sources/) as 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China.\n\nBasic Fun has 35 containers on the water that are expected to arrive in the US this week and next, but seven of them were sent on April 10 when the 145% levy became effective.\n\nForeman plans to store those containers in a warehouse because his company can’t afford the higher levy. The rest of his toys are being stored at warehouses and at his factories in China – until he gives the word to ship them here.\n\n“The retailers behavior changed after the White House meeting as if they got some confidence,” said retail guru Gerald Storch, a former CEO of Toys R Us and Canadian based department store company HBC.\n\n“They are less panicked about how quickly they need a domestic source and they seemed to relax a little bit,” Storch told The Post. “This is what I’ve heard from vendors about the retailers’ tone and sense of urgency.”\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/business/us-weighs-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-as-soon-as-next-week-sources/](https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/business/us-weighs-plan-to-slash-china-tariffs-to-as-low-as-50-as-soon-as-next-week-sources/)", "score": 698, "num_comments": 244, "created_utc": 1746735213.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1khzzl1/us_weighs_plan_to_slash_china_tariffs_to_as_low/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1khzzl1/us_weighs_plan_to_slash_china_tariffs_to_as_low/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

{"id": "1khoide", "title": "ROOT insurance blowout earnings &amp; CVNA exercising warrants", "author": "Creative-Cranberry47", "text": "Root Insurance ($ROOT) delivered a transformative Q1 2025 earnings report, marking a pivotal quarter defined by significant financial growth and strategic milestones. With substantial beats on revenue and earnings, a notable surge in policies in force, and an expanding partnership network, Root is solidifying its position as a disruptive force in the auto insurance industry. This quarter’s performance highlights Root’s technological edge and operational discipline, setting the stage for long-term leadership and a potential price target exceeding $2,000.00 per share. Below, we analyze Q1 results, management’s commentary, and the growth levers that position Root to challenge legacy insurers like Progressive ($PGR).Q1 2025 Results: Robust Financial PerformanceRoot’s Q1 2025 financials significantly outperformed expectations, showcasing strong growth across key metrics:\n\n* Revenue: $349.4 million vs. consensus $306.79 million, a $42.61 million beat.\n* Earnings Per Share (EPS): $1.15 vs. consensus $0.03, a 4000%+ beat ($18.4 million net income vs. expected $450,000).\n* Net Income and EBITDA: Net income reached $18.4 million, with EBITDA at $31.9 million, despite a $51.5 million increase in sales and marketing expenses to drive customer acquisition, which slightly tempered net income.\n* Stockholder’s Equity: Grew by $25 million, with $609.4 million in cash and equivalents, reflecting a strong balance sheet.\n* Premium Growth:\n* Unearned premiums increased $66.4 million QoQ to $420.3 million from $353.9 million. This is a helpful insight to next quarter’s earnings.\n* Written premiums rose $80.1 million to $410.8 million from $330.5 million, a 24% QoQ increase.\n* Loss and LAE Ratios:\n* Gross loss ratio improved to 56.1% from 56.9%, best-in-class among peers.\n* Gross Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE) ratio fell to 6.7% from 6.9%, signaling operational efficiency.\n* Policies in Force (PIF): Reached 453,800, up 38,938 from 414,862—a 9.4% QoQ increase, breaking from prior quarters’ flat growth (407,313, 406,283, 401,255).\n\nThis robust growth in premiums, PIF, and profitability underscores Q1 as a pivotal moment, demonstrating Root’s ability to scale effectively while maintaining industry-leading loss ratios.Q1 2025 Management Commentary: Strategic MomentumRoot’s leadership provided clear insights into the drivers of Q1’s success and ongoing strategic initiatives:\n\n* Geographic Expansion: CEO Alex Timm announced that Root is pending regulatory approvals in Michigan, Washington, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, bringing its footprint to 39 states. In a separate interview, Jason Shapiro, VP of BD, has expressed confidence in achieving nationwide coverage by 2026.\n* Partnership Growth: Timm highlighted that Root now has over 20 partners, including recent additions like Hyundai and Experian. He noted that the partnership channel grew more than 100% year-over-year, with strong contributions from financial services, automotive, and agent subchannels.\n* Direct Channel Performance: Timm attributed Q1’s PIF growth to strong direct channel results, driven by seasonality and optimized data funnels that enhanced customer acquisition cost (CAC) efficiency.\n\nThese comments emphasize the strategic execution behind Q1’s significant growth, positioning Root for continued expansion.Outlook: A Disruptive Force in InsuranceRoot’s Q1 2025 performance is a springboard for its ambition to reshape the trillion plus U.S. insurance market. Its technological and strategic advantages position it to outpace legacy insurers, offering a compelling long-term investment opportunity.Technological Leadership: The Holy Grail of InsuranceRoot’s closed-loop underwriting system, powered by telematics, AI, and automation, delivers a best-in-class 56.1% loss ratio, far surpassing legacy insurers mired in outdated COBOL systems. This technological edge enables Root to achieve superior pricing accuracy and operational efficiency. Long-term, with ROOT”s technological advantage, I could see ROOT achieving a 75% combined ratio, driven by its industry-leading loss ratios and an expense ratio potentially below 15% (compared to GEICO’s 10.8% expense ratio in Q1 2025). This would make Root 2-5X more profit-efficient per policy than legacy peers. This would mean, it would take a single Root policy to potentially equal 5 competitor policies. Let that sink in, as this allows ROOT to gain significant income off a small amount of PIF growth. It won’t take much PIF growth for ROOT to contend with its legacy peers by income and market cap. This efficiency, akin to Tesla’s disruption of the auto industry by eliminating inefficiencies. Root’s modern tech stack also allows rapid code changes, making it an ideal partner for embedded insurance and agency channels. This agility enables Root to integrate seamlessly, adapt quickly, and offer competitive pricing that undercuts rivals.Partnership Dominance: A Growing EcosystemRoot’s embedded partnership strategy is a key growth lever. Their technological advantage makes them the most ideal insurer to work with due to agility and efficiency. Its recent partnerships with Hyundai, the third-largest auto group (including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis), and Experian, which leverages data on hundreds of millions of consumers, are transformative. The Hyundai partnership enables embedded insurance at the point of vehicle sale or lease, potentially surpassing the scale of Root’s existing Carvana partnership. Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis collectively sell and lease millions of vehicles annually. Experian’s marketplace could drive significant policy growth due to Root’s superior pricing. With over 20 partners and a partnership channel doubling year-over-year, Root is poised to secure additional high-profile collaborations with auto manufacturers, financial services, or tech platforms.The agency channel, publicly launched in Q4 2024, is scaling rapidly, with 13–14 daily on boardings, according to VP Jason Shapiro in a recent interview. Shapiro believes capturing half the agency market within several years is achievable, based on the current ramp-up. He also noted that many early agencies are enthusiastic about the product, allocating double-digit portfolio shares. This trajectory could lead to 1,000+ subagency partners in the near term and, in the long term representation of half of the agency market, potentially underwriting millions of policies annually by the late 2020s, generating billions in revenue growth and positioning Root to rival legacy insurers by market cap.Product Diversification: Expanding the PortfolioRoot has the potential to explore additional new products, including home, specialty, rental, health, life, and pet insurance. Its tech stack enables seamless cross-selling, potentially increasing revenue significantly. An insurance brokerage model could position Root as a one-stop shop for all insurance needs, enhancing customer retention and profitability.Potential Carvana Transaction: A Capital Infusion Carvana’s Q1 2025 earnings reported $158 million in warrant gains($278 million total Root warrant gains so far) and a $1 billion shelf offering in quarter four, suggesting a possible exercise of Root $180-$216 short term warrants. This could inject $1.4 billion in cash, boosting Root’s book value by over $10 billion (using Progressive’s 6X book value multiple) or $2.1 billion (using a 30x multiple with 5%+ corporate investment yields). This capital could also fund a potential acquisition for new products which will increase ROOT’s auto product stickiness increasing revenue and cross-selling possibilities doubling potential revenue which an acquisition like this could drive 10X+ returns in the long term.Long-Term Vision: A $2,000+ Price TargetRoot’s Q1 2025 performance signals its potential to emulate Progressive’s historical success, but with faster growth driven by AI, automation, and digital channels. Investing in Root today is akin to buying Progressive in 1980 at $0.05 per share, which yielded a 5700X+ return. Root’s technological leadership, partnership momentum, and profit efficiency could propel it to a market cap rivaling Progressive’s $150 billion+. With half the agency market, major embedded partnerships, and a potential 75% combined ratio through ROOT’s ai tech stack, Root could generate billions in net income by late 2020’s/2030’s. A $2,000+ price target reflects this potential, driven by:\n\n* Revenue Scale: Billions in written premiums via partnerships and subagencies.\n* Profitability: 2-5X profit efficiency vs. legacy peers.\n* Valuation Premium: A multiple reflecting Root’s disruptive potential.\n\nConclusion: A Defining Moment for RootRoot Insurance’s Q1 2025 earnings mark a pivotal quarter of significant growth, driven by best-in-class loss ratios, a thriving partnership ecosystem, and a technological edge that legacy insurers cannot match. As Root expands its agency channel, secures high-profile partners, and diversifies its product offerings, it is poised to disrupt the trillion plus U.S. insurance market. Investors today are betting on the future of insurance—a future where Root could lead, much like Tesla did in the automotive industry, by enhancing profit efficiency and innovation. With a long-term price target exceeding $2,000, Root offers a compelling opportunity for those who see technology reshaping industries.Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and not financial advice.

{"id": "1khldjj", "title": "Personal anecdote as somebody working in the South Korean commercial real estate sector.", "author": "Psilonemo", "text": "I work in the South Korean commercial real estate industry—tip of the spear in terms of leverage. We're basically the real estate version of irresponsible hedge funds.\n\nSince late 2023, construction volume and new projects have essentially ceased. The cost of borrowing became too expensive, and the credit ratings of various companies were arbitrarily downgraded due to high interest rates. I know—what a surprise. The market’s ability to “digest” new supply has markedly decreased. Some of the properties we built either went bankrupt during construction—because our contractors were overleveraged themselves—or failed because we couldn’t meet our quotas selling units in advance. (In Korea, buildings are financed with leverage and pre-sales.)\n\nI’m currently handling the paperwork for two such sites where the construction contractors went bankrupt and had to transfer their responsibilities to an asset trust or management company. The number of active real estate agents has more than halved, and the number of new brokerages opened this year has also dropped by over half compared to last year. I'm currently in locked in a debate with my bosses (one of whom is my own Dad) on not laying off too many workers and keeping the good ones. To think it's come to this, having to choose who essentially gets fired and who does not, because my family has lost too much money trying to keep our office afloat...\n\nIn other words, we’re already in a recession. If you don't feel it, you're lucky, slow, an artist, or fix pipes.\n\nHaving experienced a full cycle of stimulus since COVID—back when anybody and everybody could borrow money with little to no due diligence, and making money was easy—I can say with full confidence that **everyone** who participated in the bubble shares the blame. In my experience, all three parties—buyers, contractors, and lenders—succumbed to FOMO, greed, and hype. All of us.\n\nThe market at large is full of irresponsible buyers who ended up with black credit scores and broken marriages, bruising the market in the process. They blame corporations, brokers, slick advertisers, and even the banks—despite being the ones who couldn’t repay their loans. In Korea, there’s a mindset that if you lost money, you're a victim, but if you made money, you're a genius. People hate the rich, yet behave the same. They want to privatize gains and socialize losses.\n\nContractors, broadly speaking, acted as irresponsible developers—creating bizarre, opulent, or economically questionable buildings that now suffer from low or zero demand, and remain aesthetically hopeless. The few buyers who did move in are angry that their units didn’t skyrocket in value, so they sue us. Meanwhile, we have to delay paying fees and taxes on the unsold units we still had to build. Multiple developers are already filing for bankruptcy or pleading with local authorities for bailouts or policy reforms to support failing projects.\n\nBanks and institutions acted as irresponsible lenders, benchmarking each other and cutting corners because their executives demanded they compete with other finance teams raking in returns during the bubble. They relaxed due diligence to secure deals they had no business taking—only to end up with non-performing loans, spent on assets no one wants in a traumatized market. Now they claim to be victims of federal interest rates and \"macroeconomic conditions\"—gaslighting people into paying back debt. But let’s be real: **these** are the same people who started the pyramid scheme.\n\nThis whole practice of manipulating interest rates, of flooding the market with liquidity without oversight, only to pretend sobriety when the damage is done—this is unsustainable. This is disaster capitalism. This is financial recklessness after a bottle of vodka.\n\nMilton Friedman was right: **monetary discipline matters**. I don’t blame the Federal Reserve for doing its job. I blame the ones who really move the markets: the banks and financial institutions. Their lack of discipline has created this cycle of booms and busts.\n\nThe people will pay for it through inflation and higher taxes. Small business owners will suffer shrinking margins and rising wage pressures. Big businesses will be forced to carry on with horrible, overleveraged projects because they can’t afford failure. And the big institutions? They’ll lay off a few teams and hand the bad assets over to their lawyers. Meanwhile, they’ve already pocketed the lion’s share of the money.\n\nI’m now hoarding gold and digital assets—deflationary, transactional instruments—as pure currencies or commodities. I'll probably add more commodities, including oil, when it finally gives way and dives straight down.\n\nI don’t care what anyone says. I **know** we’re in a recession. I live through it every day. FOMO at your own risk.\n\nEDIT: For those among you who want to look things up I'll give you some names.   \n제일건설, 신태양건설, 천우건설산업, 우호건설, 신동아건설, 대저건설, 남명건설", "score": 55, "num_comments": 28, "created_utc": 1746694418.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1khldjj/personal_anecdote_as_somebody_working_in_the/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1khldjj/personal_anecdote_as_somebody_working_in_the/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

And as direct as that is, it doesn't do us much good in a scenario where the bearish and bullish indicators are both priced in and weigh about the same. \n\nImagine two forces pushing against one another and a slight dominance constantly shifts back and forth between them. Then as headlines come out, large shifts in pressure occur in either direction depending on the news. This is volatility. \n\nThe volatility is the easy part to understand, it's the nearly equal, simultaneous pressure of bullish and bearish pricing of the market that is more difficult for people to grasp. Most people seem to think one thing is priced in or not. That's not how it works. Everything is priced in, it's just a matter of what is more priced in. Bullish sentiment or bearish? And if you're a trader, are you fast enough to ride the waves of the headlines?\n\nPerfect evidence of this can be found by looking at investment strategies of large firms. Many large firms hold conflicting strategies with each other. Some are pricing in more defensive allocations while others are still more offensive. Both are, and should be, very diversified in regard to market sentiment. \n\nThe more diversified the portfolio, the more balanced the market forces that are being applied to said portfolio. A 50/50 allocation doesn't eliminate the chances of experiencing market risk though, it just dampens the blow. \n\nGraphic created using ChatGPT, all data was verified.

The idea would use the administration’s authorities to force prices down.\n\nThe proposal has not been finalized and could still change as aides work through the specifics, said the people involved in the plan, who were granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations. Trump has not yet personally approved the plan.\n\nThe president on Tuesday teased a “very big announcement” within the next week that one of the people familiar characterized as a reference to the drug pricing proposal. The other two did not know whether it was the big announcement but confirmed the drug price plan was likely to be announced in the next week.\n\n“We’re going to have a very, very big announcement to make — like as big as it gets,” Trump said. “It will be one of the most important announcements that have been made in many years about a certain subject.”\n\nShould Trump go ahead with the order, it would represent a major confrontation between the White House and the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTrump [announced plans for a similar initiative](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/25/trump-medicare-drug-prices-plan-888607) in 2018, but it failed to gain traction in the face of sharp resistance from the drug industry. He later tried to [push the policy through](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/17/trump-seeks-final-stamp-on-drug-prices-with-sweeping-rule-437191) in the final months of his first term. But a judge halted the effort after determining the administration failed to follow the proper processes for implementing it, and the incoming Biden administration opted to rescind the policy.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday was coy about the proposal.\n\n“The President will make a big and historic announcement on Monday. Until then, everyone can keep guessing!” she said.\n\nWithin the West Wing, Trump has grown increasingly focused in recent weeks on lowering drug prices, urging aides to find policies capable of making a big dent in the cost of medicines, according to two of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump’s poll numbers have suffered in recent weeks since his tariff policies have begun to rattle markets and raise fears of widespread inflation and shortages of consumer goods.\n\nWhite House officials initially pressed congressional Republicans to draft in their megabill a “most favored nation” provision tying the cost of medicines in Medicaid to the lower prices developed countries pay abroad.\n\nBut that bid ran into opposition across the GOP conference and is unlikely to be included in the legislation, said one of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe White House is instead now expected to try to advance the drug price proposal on its own, using existing authorities to impose its “most favored nation” model.\n\nThe effort, if finalized, would likely draw massive opposition from a drug industry that has warned the idea would decimate companies’ ability to develop new drugs. It could also trigger fresh legal challenges.\n\nTrump’s order this go-around will look largely similar to his first, with even less specifics on which direct medicines are targeted, said one of the people familiar.", "score": 408, "num_comments": 169, "created_utc": 1746661796.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1khc9nl/politico_trumps_big_announcement_is_medicare_drug/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1khc9nl/politico_trumps_big_announcement_is_medicare_drug/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.\n\nNews: [Xi Fortifies China's Economy Before First Talks On Trade With Us](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/xi-fortifies-china-s-economy-before-first-talks-on-trade-with-us)\n\n[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)\\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vph9a7871dze1.png?width=1531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2911a2cbbc079252927a02d77d1e3a8208df98f0\n\n[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&amp;p=d)\\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15tz50g51dze1.png?width=1531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38fc4750875cc722beb52f779e27a68708c5b86\n\n[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level.

I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff.

{"id": "1kgvhak", "title": "Disney lifts profit outlook after delivering solid parks, streaming results", "author": "callsonreddit", "text": "Disney ([DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)) reported fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, driven by a rebound in its domestic parks business and strong performance in its streaming unit.\n\nThe company raised its full-year profit forecast to $5.75 a share, up 16% from fiscal 2024 and roughly double its prior guidance for high single-digit growth. Analysts had expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share to come in at $5.44.\n\nDisney stock jumped as much as 8.5% in early premarket trading before paring gains to rise around 6%.\n\nThe report comes as President Trump's [shifting tariff policies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-meets-with-canadas-carney-hints-at-coming-pharma-tariffs-191201378.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) cast a shadow over many companies this earnings season. In its release, the company acknowledged the uncertainty, stating, \"We continue to monitor macroeconomic developments for potential impacts to our businesses and recognize that uncertainty remains regarding the operating environment for the balance of the fiscal year.\"\n\n# Streaming surprise\n\nDisney+ added 1.4 million subscribers in the quarter, a beat compared to the 1.25 million subscriber loss analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. The company reported a drop of 700,000 paying users in Q1 as a result of expected user churn [from recent price hikes.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-joins-peacock-max-and-others-in-raising-prices-heres-what-it-means-for-your-subscription-costs-135639309.html)\n\nIn the midst of those price increases, along with other initiatives like password sharing crackdowns, the company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming unit, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted a profit of $336 million. That's up from $47 million one year ago and also ahead of analyst expectations.\n\nIt marked the fourth straight quarter of profitability for the streaming business.\n\n[Achieving consistent profits in streaming](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-turned-profits-in-2024-wall-streets-biggest-worry-is-whether-momentum-can-last-150537831.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) is critical for Disney and other media giants as more consumers shift to DTC services from traditional pay-TV packages. The company has a streaming profit target of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025.\n\nOverall, revenue of $23.62 billion beat expectations of $23.05 billion in the quarter and represented a 7% increase from the prior-year period.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.45 came in ahead of the $1.20 expected by analysts polled by Bloomberg. Earnings increased 20% from a year ago.\n\n# Domestic parks soar as international lags\n\nDisney's parks business faces continued pressure from broader economic uncertainties and intensifying competition, [particularly with the upcoming launch of NBCUniversal's Epic Universe](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-cfo-comfortable-with-theme-park-price-hikes-warns-of-negative-impact-from-universals-epic-universe-214247010.html), which could draw visitors away from Disney’s Florida attractions.\n\nBut that didn't weigh on domestic profits in the second quarter.\n\nThe company posted a 13% rise in operating income at its domestic parks, aided by an uptick in theme park attendance and [the successful launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-is-all-in-on-cruise-ships-heres-why-investors-should-care-110003516.html)This was a stark rebound compared to the 5% decline in domestic operating income [the company reported in Q1.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-price-hikes-help-fuel-earnings-growth-as-streaming-business-posts-profit-144131406.html)\n\nDisney also saw an increase in guest spending at the parks, bucking fears of a [consumer and tourism pullback in the US](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-tale-of-2-consumers-high-earners-doing-fine-while-lower-income-households-under-some-pressure-100009997.html). This was offset by the higher costs needed to expand the cruise line, with two more ships set to launch later this year.\n\nBut international parks disappointed amid greater macroeconomic pressures. The segment posted a significant 23% drop in operating income, driven by lower theme park attendance and increased costs at Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nHeading into the report, Needham analyst Laura Martin said she was most interested in attendance at Disney’s Shanghai and Hong Kong parks, viewing it as a proxy for the global strength of the US brand.\n\nDisney previously said it expects 6% to 8% operating income growth in its parks segment for fiscal year 2025, with expectations for stronger performance in the latter half of the year.\n\nNotably, the company said it took a $109 million content impairment charge in the quarter. It reported a roughly $50 million charge in Q1 [due to its Venu Sports joint venture exit ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venu-sports--the-proposed-sports-streaming-venture-between-espn-fox-and-warner-bros--is-no-more-150011767.html)earlier in the year.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-lifts-profit-outlook-after-delivering-solid-parks-streaming-results-105454782.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-lifts-profit-outlook-after-delivering-solid-parks-streaming-results-105454782.html)", "score": 12, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1746618982.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1kgvhak/disney_lifts_profit_outlook_after_delivering/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kgvhak/disney_lifts_profit_outlook_after_delivering/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

Germany’s [KBA trade group reported](https://www.kba.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Fahrzeugzulassungen/2025/pm20_2025_n_04_25_pm_komplett.html;jsessionid=FEFAC5A6CA4AC8B9AE83C7FF08398DD3.live21321) registrations dipped 46% in the country to 885. The country is home to Tesla’s only European factory. BYD saw its German registrations jump over 755% to 1,566 units.\n\nTesla registrations also fell in key territories like France (down 59%), Denmark (down 67%), and Sweden (down 81%), per Bloomberg data polling national auto associations. The drops in April mirror [tumbling European sales in March](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sales-tumble-again-in-key-european-regions-163357687.html) as well.\n\nTesla shares were down 2% in early trade on Tuesday.\n\nTesla bulls attribute depressed demand to the new Model Y changeover, which also resulted in a production slowdown. However, the EV maker began deliveries of the new Model Y, although only for the all-wheel drive version, in European regions like Germany in March. Whether those deliveries ramped up to a higher volume is unclear at this point. But what is clear is that the new Model Y is available for delivery.\n\nTwo factors are of greater concern to Tesla in Europe. The ramping up of BYD sales in European territories is eating into Tesla sales in several European countries. In addition, even legacy automakers like Volkswagen ([VOW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW.DE))[,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW.DE/) Ford ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), and Fiat saw sales gains in April.\n\nThe other big factor: CEO Elon Musk and his polarizing behavior. Musk's closeness to President Trump — and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe — have had an impact on Tesla's brand. [Protests, for instance, at Tesla showrooms in the US](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/business/musk-doge-tesla-demonstrations/index.html) and abroad are ongoing. Also, owners are trading in their vehicles at alarming rates, leading to [falling prices in the secondary market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-used-vehicle-prices-are-tumbling-another-worrying-sign-for-the-ev-maker-161433870.html).\n\nWith Tesla’s brand suffering and sales sliding in Q1, Musk said on the company’s [latest earnings call](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-rises-after-musk-says-time-at-doge-will-drop-significantly-124551548.html) that he would be “allocating far more” of his time to Tesla.\n\nThat move by Musk to promise a curtailing of activity in Washington in order to increase time at Tesla’s Austin HQ comes as the Tesla board may have reached a breaking point.\n\nThe [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-musk-ceo-search-board-0ce61af9?mod=hp_lead_pos1) reported last week that Tesla’s board of directors was in the initial stages of a formal process to find the EV maker’s next CEO. The board, according to the Journal, also told Musk he needed to spend more time back at the company and needed to let Tesla investors and the public know he was returning.\n\nTesla chair Robyn Denholm categorized the story as “absolutely false,” but analysts believe the showdown between Musk and the board was “very tense” before Musk very publicly vowed to spend more time at Tesla.\n\nTesla shares are down 32% year to date.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-troubles-european-business-is-getting-worse-as-sales-slump-in-april-155815479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-troubles-european-business-is-getting-worse-as-sales-slump-in-april-155815479.html)", "score": 47, "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": 1746563194.0, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/1kges55/tesla_troubles_european_business_is_getting_worse/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kges55/tesla_troubles_european_business_is_getting_worse/", "subreddit": "StockMarket"}

Analysts on average expect $3.75 billion in annual sales, according to data from LSEG.\n\nPalantir's shares are up more than 60% this year, widely outperforming the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, which is down more than 3%, as investors expect the company to benefit from AI deployment and government spending on defense-related tech even as global markets falter because of trade-related uncertainties.\n\nCo-founded by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, Palantir has been increasingly diversifying into commercial applications as it works to reduce its dependence on government spending.\n\nPalantir now expects U.S. businesses to drive more than $1.18 billion in sales this year, up from its earlier expectation of more than $1.08 billion. It also forecast second-quarter revenue above estimates.\n\nStill, a significant portion of Palantir's sales is led by its services for governments, such as supplying software that visualizes the position of troops in a battle. The company's early financial backers included the CIA's venture arm, In-Q-Tel.\n\nThe U.S. government represented more than 42% of revenue in the three months ended March 31. Total sales of $883.9 million during that period beat estimates of $862.8 million.\n\nBig U.S. government contractors such as Accenture and IBM have flagged a hit to their businesses from cost-cutting efforts by President Donald Trump's administration mostly through the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nDuring an interview with Reuters, Palantir's executives did not directly address questions on whether DOGE spending cuts, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, would impact the company's contracts.\n\n\"Focus on efficiency is excellent for Palantir.

I'm 31, basically single, no kids, and I've been investing since my young teens. I'm starting to kind of wonder what I'm even trying to accomplish anymore. I have a good job, so I don't plan on leaving, but I definitely hunger for the chance to quit working full time and focus on things I love + my side projects, so if anything happens to this job I want to be in the position to simply stay unemployed as long as I'd like.\n\nI’m wondering if I should start proactively building a portion of my portfolio around income-producing investments (like dividends, REITs, etc.) with the intention of:\n\n* Hedging against fluctuations in my website income (see income section below) or day job loss\n* Potentially covering part of my expenses if I ever do take a break from work\n* Diversifying my income more as well as putting profits from side projects into something that generate future returns\n\nI’m still actively investing in long-term growth, but I want to diversify into something that provides cash flow without needing to sell off assets. This would be where I invest 100% of my side business income while I'm still working full time.\n\n# My Current Situation:\n\n# Income\n\n* **Day job**: $127k/year as a software developer. Remote, very annoying but not difficult, 27 days of PTO, 12 paid holidays, but unfulfilling. Been here 10 years. I’m not planning to leave because it's such a good gig, but if something changes I would like to not look for a new job.\n* **Side income**: \\~$65k/year from a portfolio of websites. Stable so far, with &lt;10% operating expenses, but not guaranteed forever. I am working on diversifying this, but it isn't well diversified now so it could swing a lot.\n\n# Living expenses\n\n* Based in the U.S. (Ohio). Living comfortably on under $3k/month. I spend a lot more on activities but could cut most of those expenses if needed.\n\n# Retirement Accounts\n\n* **401(k)** – $180k\n   * 46% pre-tax, 28% Roth (from earlier years), 26% match\n   * Contributing 15% pre-tax currently\n* **Roth IRA** – $75,600 (no longer eligible to contribute)\n\n# Taxable Investments\n\n* **Edward Jones**:\n   * \\~$14k in old mutual funds,\n   * $110k in an inherited IRA. This is in some type of managed mututal fund. I have 9 years to pull it out before it's forced out and whenever I take it I have to pay income taxes.\n* **Vanguard**:\n   * $140k VTSAX, adding $250 every other week automatically.\n   * $6k SCHD (testing the dividend waters)\n   * $3k VTIAX\n   * $7.5k in miscellaneous ETFs from an old robo-advisor\n   * $7.5k cash (was considering putting this into income-generating assets)\n* **Individual Stocks**: $59k total\n   * Mostly in $1.5k–$4k chunks, with $18k in MSFT (bought for $2k when Steve Ballmer resigned lol)\n\n# Cash / Bonds\n\n* $60k in a 4% money market\n* $10k in a 6.25% Goldman Sachs bond\n* $10k in a 6.25% Royal Bank of Canada bond\n* \\~$8k in savings\n\n$25k in BTC roughly.

No physical assets of value.\n\nI’m looking for input on the following:\n\n* Is it wise to start building a meaningful income-generating segment in my taxable portfolio as a safety net, or should I stay focused on total return and growth?\n* What kind of allocation would make sense if I wanted to cover, say, $1k/month in passive income over the next 5 years?\n* For those who’ve added income investments (like dividend ETFs, REITs, or bond ladders), did it give you peace of mind or feel like a drag on growth?\n* Any recommendations for specific strategies or funds?\n\nTrying to balance the idea of building a strong growth portfolio for official early retirement, but also trying to diversify my actual income on a shorter timeline.

{"id": "1kgb7xk", "title": "I've done some calculations and thinking of retiring this December but hoping for somebody else to see if I'm missing something", "author": "LarryJones818", "text": "What I'm looking for with this thread, is for you guys to give me feedback on whether or not I'm making the right decision. But, I only want to focus on a very specific aspect. Basically, I'm saying to ignore everything else, but the specific facts that I'm trying to decide between.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I'm going to retire sometime before January 1st 2027. My only question is **when** between now and late December 2026.\n\nHere are the 4 most logical options for me:\n\n1. Late December 2025\n2. Late March 2026\n3. Late September 2026\n4. Late December 2026\n\nHere's some current facts: I'm 54 years old. I turn 55 in mid-September. I work for the State of California. I'm in the 2% at 55 retirement thing. \n\nAbout my medical coverage: The State of California essentially gives a monthly allotment to retirees for their medical coverage. The question is, what percentage of this allotment does the retired employee get, and how much is the plan that the retired employee is going to use? The way I understand it, the current monthly allotment that the State is giving is $1060 (something like that). If you have 20 years of State Service, then the state will cover 100 percent of that monthly allotment. Meaning, if the health care plan that you choose costs 1k per month, you wouldn't have any deduction for your medical costs out of your pension check, because you'd be fully covered. If the health care plan you choose costs $1100 per month, you'd have a deduction of $40 per month.\n\nIf I retire at the end of December this year, my medical allotment would be 98 percent (or very close). This is because I will fall short of 20 years, just barely. 98 percent of $1060 is $1038.80. Thus, I'd be short $21.20 per month off the maximum coverage. The plan that I'm currently using is Western Health Advantage. My current plan is around $920 per month or something like that. So, I currently don't have any money deducted from my work checks for medical. When I'm retired, I would likely use a plan similar to Western Health Advantage, thus, my medical costs would be the same as if I had the full 20 years of service.\n\nThe one exception to this, is if I decide to leave California. If I leave California, I would need to have the PERS Platinum plan. This plan costs about $1350 or something like that. Thus, I'd have about $311 deducted from my pension check if I decide to live outside of California. If I had 20 years of service, that deduction would be about $22 less per month.\n\nCOLA Situation: The State of California does a 2% COLA basically, but it's delayed by 16 months. It starts on May 1st in the following year from your retirement. For example, if I retire in late December 2025, my retirement year is 2025, and my first 2 percent COLA adjustment would happen on May 1st 2027.\n\nIf I retire in late December 2026, my first 2 percent COLA adjustment would happen on May 1st 2028.\n\nIf I retire in late March of 2026, I get screwed from the standpoint of the COLA, because it's exactly the same as if I retired on the last day of 2026.\n\nMy monthly pension estimate, after federal and state taxes witholding will be about $1550, if I retire at the very end of this year.\n\n(I will mostly be living off money in brokerage accounts, Roth IRA's, etc.)\n\nIf I waited until late December 2026, my pension amount would increase by about $138.38 per month, to $1688.38\n\nNOTE: These numbers aren't exact. I'm a permanent intermittent employee with the State of California and my hours can vary from month to month. I'm doing these calculations based on the hours that I've been averaging over the previous 9 months. Having said all of that, the estimations should be pretty close.\n\n\nMy pension amount increases every 3 months from my birthday (roughly). This is why late March 2026 is a consideration. The advantage of retiring in late March, is because it'd be one additional 3-month period, and I'd also likely have the full 20 years and thus would get the full allotment of the monthly amount that the State pays towards medical. This *could* save me about $22 per month, if I end up choosing a more expensive health plan in the future, or leave California and need to choose their most expensive plan. The bump in pension would be very, very small.\n\nThe huge downside to retiring in late March 2026, is that I missed my COLA window, and now my first COLA adjustment will basically be delayed one year, compared to me retiring in late 2025.\n\nLate September 2026 is a consideration, just because I would turn 56 years old. Thus, there would be three (3 month periods) of a bump to the pension amount. Again, the bump is relatively small in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI had all the calculations for the differences in pension amount for each of the four options, but I can't find that breakdown right now. I just know that from late December 2025 to late December 2026, it's about a $138.38 bump (roughly).\n\nThe main reason that I'm thinking about pulling the trigger this December, instead of waiting an additional year, is because of the COLA scenario. \n\nI ran the numbers for what it'd be like if I got my pension for 7 years, starting on Jan 1st, 2026, and what it'd be like if I delayed one year and started on Jan 1st, 2027 with the pension a bit higher.\n\nLate December 2025 after 7 years = $137,495.56\nLate December 2026 after 6 years = $127,103.00\n\nAs you can see, retiring a year early is an advantage by $10,392.56\n\nHowever, if I remove the first year of 12 pension payments of $1550 each, then retiring early is a disadvantage by $8,207.44\n\nIn my mind, being able to be retired a full year early is essentially going to cost me $8,207.44 (after 7 years), but I think it's more than worth it. \n\nMy life expectancy is relatively low due to some heart conditions and high blood pressure (not related to weight or exercise). Most of the calculators have me living till 73 to 75 or so. If I had to bet my entire life savings on my death year, I'd say that I'm checking out at 68.\n\nI wouldn't be super, super shocked to make it to 75 years old, but I would be very, very surprised to make it to 80.\n\nThis is another reason why I'm thinking of pulling the trigger this December. If I only live another 20 years, this extra year would be huge.\n\nThe bottom line is that I'm absolutely retiring sometime before January 1st 2027. So, there isn't anything that's going to change this. It's only a matter of \"when\". So that's the main concern.\n\nI'm not going to get into how much money is in my brokerage accounts, or what my monthly drawdown will be, or my monthly spend, yada yada yada. All that information is immaterial, because I have a hard date that I'm not going past. \n\nTo me, it's almost a no-brainer to retire this year because of the COLA situation, but I just want to make sure there isn't something that I'm completely forgetting about", "score": 10, "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1746554550.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1kgb7xk/ive_done_some_calculations_and_thinking_of/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kgb7xk/ive_done_some_calculations_and_thinking_of/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

{"id": "1kgdlg4", "title": "The Time Value of Money", "author": "Fringe_Doc", "text": "Greetings,\n\nSometimes one comes across the \"time value of money\" as a concept for decision making in personal finance.\n\nIs it \"worth it\" to drive further to the gas station with a lower price?  What about shopping for specials at 2 or 3 grocery stores, instead of just one?\n\nTypically, one considers rate of pay per hour.  Sometimes, this will be made more representative by considering net pay (after tax), or adding in commuting time or time spent preparing for work, etc.  But this is typically most intuitive in one's accumulation (typically entailing full-time work) phase.\n\nMy question is, how does one go about considering this during retirement / decumulation?\n\nI posed the question to my wife, who I don't think took it seriously (deeming it both not useful and impossible to calculate).\n\nSome possible approaches I have read about and/or personally considered:\n\n1. Take your current \"spend\" and convert that into a 40 hour per week equivalent (e.g., very roughly ... you spend $4000 / month or $1000 / wk ... and then chop this into hours ... 1000 / 40 = $25).\n2. Considering that money is \"a renewable resource\" whereas our time is limited and dwindling ... perhaps the value in retirement is actually GREATER to what it is during work.  Let's assume you could know for a fact that you have one year remaining of functional activity in your \"Go-Go Years\" (maybe you're like a healthy 69 y/o), but that following that year, you'll be housebound until you die.  Should you not value that year more than a random year chosen in your 20s?\n3. We could consider something analogous to PYLL (Productive Years of Life Lost), a metric used in healthcare economics to define whether it is societally justifiable to pay for people's medical care.  Last time I checked, the \"value of human life\" in Canada was around $80,000 / PYLL.  Of course, one quickly runs into problems re: \"how do you define productive?\" and it spirals from there.\n4. Similar to number 3 ... I suppose you could use per capita GDP as a starting point.  (But is a retiree contributing the GDP in a similar way as a F/T worker?)\n\nLet's assume that we CAN calculate some metric for decumulation folk with respect to the above.  How might one use it in practice?\n\nLet's assume your time value (TV) is $20 / hr.  You have a \"hateful task\" that must be done (weeding the garden?  scrubbing toilets?).  If you can find a way to outsource this for TV or lower, then it makes sense to pay for it to be done by somebody else.\n\nAnother example.  Let's say you are interested in supporting Charity XYZ.  There are opportunities to serve and/or donate.  Would you rather write a cheque for $1000 or volunteer 3 hours per week for 3 months?\n\nI am very much interested to hear what the community is able to come up with.\n\nFor your consideration.", "score": 28, "num_comments": 29, "created_utc": 1746560330.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1kgdlg4/the_time_value_of_money/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kgdlg4/the_time_value_of_money/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

I’ve been offered a severance package worth about 28 weeks of pay and benefits. Including that, I’d leave with \\~21x annual expenses saved. I also get a modest pension starting in 20 years, worth about 30% of my inflation-adjusted annual spend.\n\nFICalc gives me a 64% chance of being financially independent for 40 years. I’ve also got $80k in short term Treasuries, so between that and severance, I wouldn’t need to tap the market for awhile if there’s a downturn.\n\nRight now I like my job, but a full-time return-to-office has been draining.

Possibly re-enter the workforce later in a seasonal or purpose focused role.\n\nOne other (big) wrinkle is that I might need surgery soon, so keeping the safety net of employer healthcare and FMLA for now would reduce stress, and the health issue is currently limiting my freedom a bit.\n\nI have a good reputation at work, but a small external network. I don’t naturally interview well, and I dread the idea of chasing a similar job elsewhere.

{"id": "1kei4n5", "title": "Post-FIRE 3yr Update: 37F SINK former accountant", "author": "jellybean83087", "text": "**TL DR:** FIREd in May 2022 with $885k, current NW is $1.1M. Last year's expenses totaled $34k. NW peaked at $1.2M in Feb, watching it drop $100k in two months has been slightly unsettling. Life wise, I've been in Japan since last April attending a language school. This has been a great way to experience what life is like in Japan, challenge my brain, and socialize with locals and foreigners. Once my visa ends in June, I’ll visit my family in the US and then travel to China and SE Asia next. All is well; I'm still FIREd, happy and thriving.\n\n**Background:** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/137vg2p/35f_sink_nw_900k_former_accountant_post_fire_1st/) is the link to my first year update. 2nd Year is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1chjz7j/fired_36f_sink_2nd_year_update/)\n\n**Life Update:** I’ve been living in Tokyo on a student visa through a Japanese language school since last April. Classes are held 3 hours a day five days a week. I lucked out and had afternoon classes from 1pm to 4pm. I like to start my mornings slowly so this schedule was ideal. I typically wake up between 9 to 10am, maybe workout and have lunch before going to class. Attending classes gave structure to my days while also opening doors to social connections and deeper cultural experiences.\n\nLiving in Japan has been a lifelong dream of mine. I first experienced it during a study abroad semester over a decade ago, and ever since then, I've wanted to come back to spend a year or more improving my Japanese and experiencing what normal life is like here year round. FIRE has finally made this possible, and it's been everything I hoped for - from the fresh spring cherry blossoms to the vibrant autumn leaves.\n\n My Japanese has progressed from just being able to order food to now having basic conversations with shopkeepers and locals. I was able to pass the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level N2 last December. There's something deeply satisfying about that progress. Oh, in between classes I also managed to summit Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan. Checking 'climb an iconic active volcano' off my bucket list feels pretty sweet. #HumbleBrag\n\nLiving in Tokyo has been surprisingly comfortable. I’m renting a bedroom in a decent sharehouse about 15 minutes from my school by foot. It's small by American standards but has everything I need and feels quite cozy. The neighborhood has plenty of affordable restaurants, convenience stores, and is close to a nice park where I sometimes read or people-watch. Living close to school not only helps me save on the ticket fare, it also saves me from rush hour commute. I can’t stand being packed into a train car like sardines in a can.\n\n**Finances:** I FIREd in May 2022 with $885k. Current NW is around $1.1M. My asset allocation is approximately 55% VGT, 40% VTSAX and 5% cash. Although my NW peaked at $1.2M in Feb, watching it drop $100k due to market volatility has been wild. There was a dopamine hit each time my NW climbed up last year. Given the recent downturn, I’ve stopped checking it as often. I mean there’s no good reason to intentionally make oneself unhappy, right?\n\nThis is exactly why I built a couple years of cash cushion before pulling the trigger on FIRE - to weather sequence of returns risk without panicking. Since pulling the plug in 2022, I haven’t had to withdraw from my stock portfolio because I was cash heavy from selling my house initially. Then, early last year I sold my car for $10k. This past year, I’m happy to say that the $35k I had loaned to a relative was fully repaid back to me. It was really fortunate that this personal loan worked out in the end, and I got my money back without any issues. So after all that, I currently have $50k cash left which hopefully should cover me until the markets recover a bit.\n\n2024 expenses totaled $34k. The biggest expenses were $6k language school tuition, $6k rent annually, and $8k was spent paying for a two-week vacation in Japan for my mom. My mom wanted to see Tokyo, Mt. Fuji and cherry blossoms so I was happily able to fulfill her dream by treating her to an all expenses paid vacation. Seeing her joy while experiencing Japan made every yen worth it.\n\n Food and public transportation in Japan are fairly cheap. A typical meal costs less than $10, and the quality and level of service is by far better than the US. Due to the weak yen and strong dollar exchange rates, it feels like everything in Japan is 30% off. (100 yen was about $1 pre-Covid, but it’s now around 140 yen to $1) My guilty pleasures are splurging on massages and tennis lessons a few times each month.\n\n**Plans for the near future:** After my visa ends in June, I will head back to the US to visit my family and then continue to slowly travel around China and SE Asia. I am aiming to spend a few weeks to months in each place. I'm looking to find affordable apartments through Airbnb or local platforms. The cost of living in these areas should allow me to stay comfortably under my budget while experiencing new cultures and cuisines.\n\n**Some Random thoughts and Lessons Learned:**\n\n* I simplify my post FIRE life by focusing on doing something physical, something mental, and something social each day.\n\n* Make sure to cultivate frugal hobbies such as sports, gardening, cooking, hiking or board games. When I get bored I often sign up for a Meetup event, visit the community gym for a swim, weight training, or go out for a hike.\n\n* Slow travel is not only more affordable but infinitely more rewarding than rushing from place to place.\n\n* Don't sacrifice all your comforts - my splurges on massages, tennis lessons and occasional nice meals keep me happy without wrecking my budget.\n\n* Having a purpose beyond just \"not working\" makes FIRE so much more fulfilling. For me, it's language learning, cultural exploration, and sharing experiences with others.\n\n* Market volatility is much easier to handle when you've planned for it and have cash reserves. The countless FIRE reddit discussions and PF blog posts about SORR weren't just theoretical; they've proven invaluable in helping me navigate this market downturn with confidence.\n\nThanks for reading this update. I'm always happy to share more specific details about life in Japan, FIRE calculations, or travel planning if anyone's interested.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ", "score": 638, "num_comments": 147, "created_utc": 1746359925.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1kei4n5/postfire_3yr_update_37f_sink_former_accountant/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kei4n5/postfire_3yr_update_37f_sink_former_accountant/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

I usually stay in hostels, meet a lot of people, and enjoy building global connections.\n\nI’m aiming for financial independence in the next 10 years. Here’s where I currently stand:\n- Maxing out traditional 401(k)\n- Maxing out traditional IRA\n- Maxing out HSA\n- Contributing ~$20K/year to after-tax 401(k)\n- Contributing at least $1,000/month to individual taxable investment accounts\n- Net worth: ~$520,000\n\t•\t~$420,000 in investments (allocated across VOO, QQQ, and VGT)\n\t•\tThe rest in cash/savings\n\nI rent an apartment in Austin where I live with my two cats. My parents visit from India every year or so and stay with me for a couple of months—I love hosting them, so I don’t see myself going full digital nomad. I just enjoy the flexibility to travel and work from different places a few weeks or months at a time.\n\nDespite being on track financially, I sometimes worry: Am I doing enough? Most of my friends are settling down, getting married, and buying homes. I don’t know the details of their finances, but I occasionally get anxious that I’m splurging too much on travel and not planning well enough for the long term—even though I believe I’m pretty disciplined.\n\nI’m also gay but discreet (only my sister knows). I’ve dated a bit during my travels—guys in Canada, Colombia, and Mexico—but distance and language barriers made it hard to build anything lasting. I sometimes wonder if I’m not putting in enough effort to find a meaningful relationship, or if I’m unintentionally pushing that part of life to the sidelines.\n\nI’ve made a lot of friends over the years, both in the U.S. and globally, but I still feel like I’m missing that one deep connection—the kind of friend or partner you can truly rely on. That sense of emotional stability still feels out of reach, even while everything else seems to be going well.\n\nSo, my questions to this community:\n- Has anyone else been in this position—pursuing FI while living a nontraditional, mobile life?\n- How do you balance enjoying life (travel, experiences) with staying on track financially?\n- Most importantly, how do you deal with uncertainty or feeling “behind” when your peers are taking a more traditional route?\n\nWould love to hear your stories or advice.

{"id": "1kaly9e", "title": "FIRE Dilemma", "author": "easysober", "text": "Hi all - I’m a 33-year-old small business owner in St. Louis, married with a 3-year-old and another kid on the way. My wife and I are from Austin, TX, and we’re stuck deciding whether to stay here for the money or move back to Austin for a more enjoyable personal life. My wife isn't very well versed with this stuff, so I feel like I'm stuck in my own head, spinning my wheels. I could use some outside takes on whether I’m being dumb or missing something.\n\nIncome: I pull $200k base from my business, but last year hit $350k with bonuses. Probably safe to count on $300k combined going forward (wife makes $75k in an admin job, likely $100k after her Master’s, which is being paid for in cash).\n\nNet Worth: ~$1.8M including small business equity\n$50k cash\n$550k in retirement/investments\nHouse worth $600k, owe $375k at 2.5% interest\nBusiness equity has a book value at ~$1M, should hit ~$2M in 3-5 years as we clear acquisition debt (note that the market valuation should be at least 2x book value with our industry/company profile). \nSpending: We’re not huge spenders, about $5k/month not counting the house.\nSt. Louis: Super cheap to live here, so our money goes far.\n\nI like my job a lot, but I’m not a huge fan of living in St. Louis, or the Midwest in general. We don't have a ton of friends here, no family close by, just mainly here for the business. The low COL, cheap mortgage, and solid income make it a classic golden handcuffs situation. If we stick it out for 10 years, we’re basically set for FI in our early 40s. \n\nProblem is, I’m starting to burn out. The winters can get super miserable here, and the idea of staying just for the money is getting to me. I am bringing on a business manager (using ideas from the book Traction) to handle day-to-day stuff so I can focus on big-picture strategy, which should relieve my company's dependency on me being at the office. We love Austin and want our kids in high school there. I think moving would be great for our happiness (family, friends, city we love) but it’d obviously cost us. Higher COL, probably a 6-7% mortgage (our housing budget would probably triple), and I’d have to step away from the business physically, which adds risk in the sense that the business manager could crash and burn and I'd have to retake control from a managerial standpoint to right the ship. I could still make my base in Austin, plus likely bonuses once we clear the acquisition debt.\n\nI feel like I have two options on the table: Stay 7-8 years: Grind it out, hit FI, sell the business, then move. It’s definitely the safer play, but I almost feel like it'd create a limiting mindset where I'd be overly conservative to preserve my equity in the business. I’m also dragging my feet thinking about “living” only after we’re rich. Feels like I’m putting life on hold.\n\nMove in 2-3 years: Get the business running smoothly with a manager, move to Austin, and keep owning it from afar. This is definitely riskier as I will lose some operational control, and a screw-up could hurt the business’s value. Plus, the higher mortgage stings when we’ve got 2.5% now. The upside with this, however is that it'd force me to find a way to make the business run without me, which inherently makes it a higher value asset to the market when I go to sale. Also obviously wouldn't need to sell if I'm enjoying the work from a location I want to be in. \n\nI’m overthinking this to death. Staying here feels smart but depressing, like I’m betting everything on FI and missing out now. Moving feels reckless, especially with the mortgage jump and business risks. Am I crazy for wanting to prioritize location over a surefire FI? Anyone else been in a spot like this, stuck between a sweet financial setup and actually liking where you live? Is there a way to test running the business remotely without going all-in?\n\nAppreciate any advice or stories from folks who’ve been here!", "score": 32, "num_comments": 30, "created_utc": 1745927334.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1kaly9e/fire_dilemma/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kaly9e/fire_dilemma/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

I max out my 401(k) each year — employee deferrals, employer match, and after-tax contributions to hit the full IRS limit (about $69K total for 2025).\n\nFor new 401(k) contributions, I’m investing 100% into bond funds (specifically an intermediate-term bond index, VBIMX). My overall asset allocation target is 70% stocks and 30% bonds. Since my taxable brokerage and Roth accounts are heavily stock-weighted, I’m using the 401(k) to hold my bond allocation efficiently. I’m trying to keep stocks in Roth and taxable accounts for tax optimization while concentrating bonds in the 401(k), where the interest income is tax-deferred.\n\nMy plan allows in-plan Roth conversions, but Fidelity won’t let me set up automatic mega backdoor conversions until I clear out an old after-tax balance in the account. That old balance is about $135K total, and $116K of it is original after-tax contributions, but $19K is earnings that would be taxed at ordinary income rates when converted.\n\nIf I convert now, I’d owe roughly $7K in taxes on the earnings (at 37%).\n\nIf I wait a few years until my income drops, I could convert at a lower rate — probably somewhere between 24% and 32% — but there’s a risk that the earnings keep growing and push the tax bill even higher.\n\nMeanwhile, any new after-tax contributions can’t automatically convert until I deal with the old balance, and I’m probably only staying at this employer for another 2–3 years.\n\nRight now, I’m leaning toward paying the \\~$7K “unlock fee” to clear the deck. That way, I can build a clean Roth space for future contributions and maximize the Mega Backdoor opportunity. At the same time, I still have access to it, and avoid managing a messy rollover later.\n\n**I’m wondering:**\n\n* Would you go ahead and convert now, or would you wait and accept the risk that the taxable portion keeps growing?\n* Is there anything I’m overlooking about the timing or tax handling?\n* Has anyone else made a similar decision, and were you happy with it (or not)?\n\nHappy to answer questions about contribution flow, employer match setup, or Fidelity-specific mechanics if it helps others.\n\nThanks in advance for any perspective you can share.

Houses near the city are obviously more expensive, but they come with easier access to jobs, especially in tech where most companies are based in larger metros.

I don't have anyone to share this with so...reddit lol. I started my journey to financial independence after I got divorced at 21 (yes I'm military) which left me broke and completely physically and emotionally defeated. I was pretty financially illiterate at the time. I didn't budget, overspent, and I don't think I even knew what debt was.

I'm aware that I'm pretty cash heavy, which might not be necessary since I have guaranteed employment, but it gives me peace of mind. I contribute 20% of my base pay ($730) to my TSP (military/government retirement plan) every month. My IRA is maxed out for 2024 &amp; 2025. I'm going to take all the cash from my Robinhood to max out my IRA for 2026 and maybe some from my HYSA for 2027 as well. Since I can't afford to max out my TSP ($23,500 yearly max), I stick with the percentage I'm at (20%), and any other extra money I have at the end of the month I put into my taxable brokerage account with Fidelity (SPAAX). I currently rent and as noted above, have **zero** debt.\n\n  \nThis is a HUGE milestone for me personally, especially given the situation I was in after I got divorced.

{"id": "1k6u0dt", "title": "FIRE by Any Other Name", "author": "dipsplode", "text": "**Hello all, long post incoming.**\n\nI have a few posts in the past regarding my position as a foreign service officer (a US diplomat) and my path toward FIRE (or FedFIRE, as I have a *minimum* retirement age of 50).\n\nWelp, things have changed! For good or bad is debatable, but as of Wednesday, I am sort of, kind of, officially FIRE’d.\n\nWhy the qualifiers?\n\n**Some Background**\n\nA couple of years ago, I changed my job / government agency while still retaining my federal retirement status as a special category employee (originally under the Foreign Service Pension System, and now under what most refer to as a Special FERS..see, Janie-Lou from seventh grade! I *told* you I was special!).  I am no longer a diplomat, but my wife still is.\n\nWithout getting political, many of you may be aware of the drastic changes to hiring (and firing) that are occurring in the federal workplace. People are being offered VERA, which is voluntary early retirement, allowing them to retire with full benefits *before* standard minimum retirement age of 57 (as long as you have X years of service), and even before 50 if you have more than 25 years of service.  This diminishes your standard retirement benefits, because it's based on years of service, but it's not a bad deal, just not great. \n\nPeople are also being offered the DRP (deferred resignation) to basically guarantee they will leave federal service by the end of the fiscal year (30 Sep 2025). These folks are losing their jobs by resigning, but will continue to get paid until their official resignation date without the threat of being actually fired (cold comfort).\n\nWhere I currently work, which will remain nameless as I am technically still employed, a *third* way was offered.\n\nFolks who were eligible to retire any time before the end of the fiscal year were offered the ability to accept the DRP, but then retire on their normal date. The retirement *supersedes* the resignation, so effectively, the government is paying folks X months of pay and leave to retire on the exact day they could earliest retire on anyway. Personally, I believe this is wasteful, but it does encourage extra folks to leave the government as early as possible. While special category employees have mandatory retirement dates, standard federal employees can technically work forever. \n\nThen someone realized, “Wait, there are folks who are eligible to retire between 01 Oct and 31 Dec...if we include them in the deal, that means even more people will leave the government...and we can count them in FY25 numbers!” Well, that group included me. I expressed interest, and much to my surprise, they accepted me, even though I will be receiving approximately 7 months of pay and leave while effectively being retired. I gave up my ID badge and was “read out” of the programs and contracts I was working as of yesterday, and though I am on the books, I am not allowed to return to work. It was a weird feeling, to say the least, to fast-forward my retirement when I have been steadily working (and expecting to work until November) until just a few weeks ago (as part of the process, you have two to four weeks to off-ramp).\n\nTo be clear, this “early” retirement is not VERA, VSIP, or a lump sum pay out for 7 months. I am simply receiving my normal paycheck and am still contributing to my retirement. That said, come the holiday season, I will actually retire. I am also not allowed to back out of this, per the contract.\n\nWhy is the government doing this, and more importantly, why are some federal agencies offering further incentives? If they can point to a decrease in federal employment at given locations by X percentage, that means they don’t have to fire more people. On paper, I am one less employee. I technically don’t have to retire (until age 60 mandatory). Now, they are guaranteeing I will retire, no take-backsies. Win-win, I guess.\n\nSo yes, I no longer have to go to work every day. I can do whatever I want (as long as it’s not working for a federal contractor or a politician), but I am not technically retired until Fall of this year. FIRE-ish?\n\n**Retire Early Info**\n\nWhen I turn 50 later this year, I will start receiving a monthly annuity (pension), I *am* allowed to begin withdrawing from my TSP (the government 401k) with no penalty, and I will receive approximately half of my expected (age 62 estimate) social security until the age of 62 (at which point I can forego or begin collecting social security). On top of this, I will receive a lump sum cash payment for all my unused vacation time (annual leave), which will now include almost an extra 100 hours, due to my not having to use any leave the rest of the year (an unexpected bonus). I will also have partially subsidized life insurance and health insurance post-retirement.\n\nFor reference, my wife, who is still with Dept of State, has *not* been offered this type of deal. Though, she isn’t eligible to retire until next year, regardless. She will receive the same general benefits.\n\nSo, where does that leave me? Well, I had to accelerate some timelines. \n\n* For the past 5+ years, we have been taking long weekends to various areas on the eastern seaboard we were considering for retirement. We have narrowed our locations and visited them several times, meeting with realtors and touring locations. Highly recommend this, unless you already have a solid idea.\n\n* We identified a final location about a year ago, bought some land with live oaks and a water view, and we are now in the process of building a semi-custom home to retire to in the south.\n\n* Our original plan was to have the house complete by Jan or Feb of 2026, we’ve now pushed it up as early as possible (likely complete early Fall 2025).\n\n* We have a middle school kid who *was* going to continue through public school in Northern Virginia (NoVA) next school year, but I will now be moving with the kid down to our retirement city this summer to start the kid in a secular private school ($6,500 a year! That’s less than we were paying for after-school care).\n\n* Per above, we are now putting our NoVA house on the market in May rather than waiting until July (this falls in line with the preferred timeline of our realtor, so I guess that’s an unintended bonus).\n\n* I will be renting a VRBO until the house is complete, and the wife will be renting a basement apartment of another State employee (much closer to work for her). This will, in the short-term, slightly increase our expected expenses from Aug thru Jan, as we were all supposed to be living together.\n\nLong story short(er), the shift in my circumstances will generally be good for the kid to adjust to the new school rather than entering mid-year, but we’ll be separated from my wife basically from Sep to Jan/Feb (not ideal). I will now be present to check in on the latter half of the build, so that’s good, and we will likely see a faster and higher-value sale of our current house, shifting the sale date to relatively peak market (yes, people are still buying houses at high prices in the NoVA region).\n\nI had not planned to work after retirement, and still do not. I am also somewhat restricted on who I can work for until my official “official” retirement date later this year. I mean, if I want to go work at the Piggly Wiggly, no big deal, but if wanted to take a government contractor job, it probably wouldn’t be approved. There would be options for contractor work where we are moving.\n\nMy wife thinks she wants to work after she retires, but that’s because she believes she will go stir-crazy. I have being trying to comfort her...*she* will not be the one who will go crazy...it will be the rest of us in having to deal with her “unemployed” anxiety. ;)\n\nAll jokes aside, we’ve been exceptionally driven people for most our lives, and surrounded by highly capable and qualified people who were just as a driven. That adjustment to ‘normal’ life and people will take some effort.\n\n**Some Rough FI Numbers**\n\nI have been tracking our finances exactly for the last 7 years. We saw some explosive growth over the last four-ish years, and “set it and forget it” has ostensibly paid off.\n\n* Our annual expenses crept up from approximately $115k in 2018 to $145k today. Most of the increase has come from insurance prices and increasing estimated tax payments.\n\n* We ran estimates on our expected expenses in the south, and even if we have a small mortgage, we’ll be coming in at $100-$125k a year with no decrease in lifestyle. I have a sneaking suspicion we’ll be spending slightly less, as we high-balled things like utilities, taxes, and groceries, most of which I know are lower.\n\n* We have no debt other than a mortgage, but we expect to see anywhere between 75% to 90% return on selling the house (NoVA prices are kind of crazy, and even as of this week, a house in our neighborhood sold in less than 24 hours with multiple over-asking bids). The sale of the house will likely cover 75% to 100% of our build costs. We are not counting on bidding wars as part of this equation, just 80% of market estimate.\n\n* We have some standard brokerage holdings that we have been pulling from for buying our land, construction deposits, and prepping the house for sale. The account is currently sitting at about $100k.\n\n* Cash on hand is about three months’ expenses.\n\n* Due to promotions (and cost of living adjustments), our income increased by about 50% over the past 5 years, which in turn, raised our estimates for pension income (which is calculated as a percentage of your high-3 salary average). Our expected total pre-tax annuity will be in the range of $105k.\n\n* Our expected FERS supplement (sometimes called the social security supplement), will be approximately $32k a year, pre-tax. This lasts until we turn 62. It is income-tested from 57 to 62, but again, I’m not planning on working, especially at that point.\n\n* Our combined 401k (TSP) value has doubled (it was *more* than double until the last two weeks), but still, doing very well (man, it is wild to see swings in the 100k range, though). I am also contributing the max catch-up, as this is the year I turn 50. We presently have about $1.5 million total. Per my current estimates, we may not need to draw from our retirement accounts to meet expenses, though for FIRE calculator purposes, we estimated 3.5% SWR.\n\n* Our current 401k (TSP) mix is 70% US Stock, 20% Intl, and 10% TIPS (technically, the G Fund).  Happy to hear recommendations for post-retirement, if anyone has them.\n\n* We do expect our tax burden to decrease post-2026 once we are both in retirement and have both received our lump-sum leave payments (this is tens of thousands). We presently have an effective tax rate of about 20%. I anticipate that going down to somewhere between 15-18%. State taxes are also expected to be slightly lower.\n\n**The Closer**\n\nAnyhow, thanks for attending my ~~TED~~ FEDtalk.\n\nAnd before anyone says it, yes, some of your taxes do pay my salary...but then, um, so do mine. You're welcome...for the discount. ;)\n\nI did not create the current situation I’m in, but I would have been a fool to not take advantage of it. I was fully expecting to be at work until the end of the year. And, as silly as it sounds, I’m glad that my departing now may mean that someone with 20 years still ahead of them gets to keep their job. \n\nI’ve done a *lot* of good for people home and abroad over the last 20+ years. Work I've done has literally saved lives on several occasions. You can’t ask for much more out of a career.\n\nAll that said, I will not miss my commute!", "score": 70, "num_comments": 18, "created_utc": 1745505894.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1k6u0dt/fire_by_any_other_name/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1k6u0dt/fire_by_any_other_name/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

{"id": "1k41nww", "title": "1 Year FIRE Update!", "author": "lifeistoughasfuck", "text": "I resigned in mid April 2024. I promised to give myself a month before I write my experience. This post is now 12 months late. I hope this gives a nuanced view of my experience thus far.\n\n# Let’s start with the wins, in true corporate performance review fashion with metrics, in the order of health, finances and others:\n\n1. Increased VO2max from 39 (poor) to 43 (fair) as reflected on my Garmin watch.\n2. Sleep score improved from mid 50s to mid 70s over the year.\n3. Cooked dinner on an average of 5 days/week for my family.\n4. Re-learnt freestyle swimming, starting from 0 and improved to 500m without rest at pace of 2:30mins/100m.\n5. Gym/run/swim on an average of 4 days/week.\n6. Cut alcohol intake from at least multiple drinks sessions per week to just 1 session month. Just for social reasons.\n7. Took zero night calls. A 180 degree change since I started my corporate career.\n8. Net worth increased by \\~$250k despite having zero income from employment.\n9. Achieved 23% 1 yr time weighted returns performance on my IBKR portfolio (Apr 2024 - Apr 2025). Yes, this included the big swings due to tariffs.\n10. Took multiple short holidays, staycations and family visits. Can’t put a metric to this.\n11. Built a top-end DIY PC. Costed me $3k. Gained joy as I built this with my 4 year old son.\n12. Improved [chess.com](http://chess.com/) ELO from 600 to 1100.\n\n# What I really liked about FIRE:\n\nI love the time. Time away from the general stresses and constraints from work to reflect, develop new perspectives and doing things that turns me on.\n\nWith more time for deeper reflection, I realized what “working” meant. The great parts are known: having a stable income, social capital, camaraderie, business travels, some degree of ego fulfillment, the perception of upward progression, increased net worth and so on.\n\nThe bad parts come along as well: general stresses that impacts my health, relationships and more importantly, my (compensating) behavior required to manage this stress. Example, placing night calls as priority that would impact sleep, which triggers a never ending cycle of chronic sleep imbalance that follows, and hence poor health and fitness. I would drink more to take my mind off work (ironically, always drinking with work colleagues). My patience would be limited. My relationship with my wife and son suffered. I am growing fat, and sick, slowly.\n\nAnother huge downside of work is that working in a traditional sense of employment is an opportunity cost. There is an opportunity cost to not doing something else. When I resigned, I had a plan. My 4% withdrawal rate well exceeded my annual burn. Also, I believed I would be able to generate further income from my wealth to sustain my family’s lifestyle. That was all I had, a plan and a belief. I didn’t know whether it would work. It was a leap of faith. One year on, the plan worked. I was executing it well and it gave me the confidence that I had an edge on the markets. (Granted, I have been trading options for income for years and had a great track record. But I had a failsafe - my employment income.) If I had continued working, I would not have been able to realized this alternate source of income that also brings along new skillsets and more importantly, a better way of life.\n\nI also loved the tactical aspects of having “more” time. Time is relative and not equal for everybody. Example, I love doing groceries when everyone is out at work on weekdays. I love exercising in an empty gym during the late mornings. I love waking up at 3am to watch EPL/Champions league. I love driving into JB for general shopping and health maintenance outside of rush hours and traffic jams. I love taking holidays during non-peak periods. I feel that I gained “more” time by using time strategically and efficiently. This was not the case when I was working.\n\n# Downsides of FIRE:\n\nIf you love structure, you may struggle with having plenty of unstructured time. I struggled with my routines, until I held myself accountable to making a routine and sticking to it. That said, you will still have lots of unstructured time. I gave myself a year to be purposefully bored, allowing myself to indulge in my whims and fancies. (This blog is one of them). But thankfully over the course of the year, I have my routines nailed by prioritizing the activities that brings me physical and mental joys.\n\nNext, if your identity is tied to your job, job title, salary, you may find it hard to adjust. I struggled at first for the first few months, mainly because all my peers of the same age range are all still working. While I understand their circumstances, they don’t understand mine. Some even find it unfathomable for me to stop working. Social meetups with peers can be challenging because work is a great proportion of the conversations. Most of the time I nod and listen, but deep inside me, I find them all so boring, inconsequential and immaterial to the broader aspects of living. Those who understands this are those who are retired, i.e. the older folks. So the key lesson here is to investigate the story of the “identify” that you tell yourself, where is this coming from, who is giving value to it and whether this identify fits your overall purpose in life. I loved that FIRE gave me this perspective.\n\nLast, the stresses of life continue. While money is not one of them, it is always on my mind. (Those who are in the FIRE journey will always think about money, trust me.) Bills continue to come, contingencies will happen - people get sick, things breakdown, domestic repairs need to be done etc. Previously during work, I outsource these fixes to the professionals as much as I can. Now, I try to fix them myself. I am glad that the availability of time allows me to do so, and at the same time, gain some useful household skills. This nature of life and things can get boring sometimes, but I’d gladly take them in exchange for the upsides mentioned above.\n\n# So, what’s next:\n\nI would like to write more on my FIRE experience. In Singapore, people talk about FIRE a lot, but few actually do it. I would like this to be an authentic space for a true FIRE content experience. Do feel free to write in and let me know what topics tickles you.

Tech companies have huge valuations that, based on PE ratios, seem unlikely to be poised for future price appreciation.\n\nSo in short, if the 4% rule really only worked in the US, and was based on analysis of historical US stock returns during 80-90 years of potentially unique factors, is it really applicable for going forward?

{"id": "1k0djlm", "title": "'Tax Float Arbitrage': Earning Risk-Free Interest by Timing Quarterly IRS Tax Payments?", "author": "Acesonnall", "text": "Hey FI community,\n\nI’ve been exploring an optimization idea I've loosely been calling '**Tax Float Arbitrage**' since I haven't been able to find a well-known name for this. Maybe that's because I'm making some fatal calculations, the juice typically isn't worth the squeeze, or I just didn't look in the right places. In any case, basically it boils down to legally delaying tax payments, investing the float, and pocketing the interest. I’d love your critical thoughts and feedback. I'm also aware that what I'm proposing, if not wildly flawed, is one of the last financial optimization levers to pull and likely shouldn't be considered before pulling all other 'easy' tier levers.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nInstead of letting the IRS hold my money all year (through paycheck withholding), I'd:\n\n* **Set W-4 withholding to near $0** (both federal and state).\n* Put money I'd normally pre-pay in taxes into a safe, liquid, interest-bearing vehicle—e.g., Treasury-only Money-Market Funds (MMFs), HYSA, or short-term T-Bills.\n* Pay quarterly estimated taxes (Form 1040-ES) to the IRS and state tax agency by each deadline, ensuring I hit the safe harbor threshold each quarter.\n\nEssentially, I'd profit from the IRS’s 'zero-interest loan period'—earning \\~4–5% APY while waiting to pay.\n\n**Quick Math (Bi-weekly Paycheck Scenario):**\n\n* Assume $25,000 annual tax liability -&gt; \\~$962 set aside per bi-weekly paycheck.\n* These funds accumulate over time in a **high-yield, low-risk account** (e.g., \\~4.2% APY).\n* Let’s look at **Quarter 1** as an example:\n\n|Pay Period|Contribution|Balance (approx)|Interest Earned (approx)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Jan 1|$962|$962|$3|\n|Jan 15|$962|$1,924|$7|\n|Jan 29|$962|$2,886|$11|\n|Feb 12|$962|$3,848|$16|\n|Feb 26|$962|$4,810|$21|\n|Mar 11|$962|$5,772|$25|\n\n* By April 15 (Q1 payment), you’ve earned **\\~$80 in interest** for the quarter.\n* Repeat across 4 quarters = **\\~$320/year in risk-free gains**, purely from timing.\n\nNot life-changing money, but:\n\n* **Zero risk** if you hit IRS deadlines,\n* **Completely under your control**,\n* And it scales with income — $50K tax liability = \\~$600–700/year upside.\n\n# The Benefits (as I see them):\n\n* **Risk-free yield** on money you'd otherwise let sit interest-free with the IRS.\n* **Higher liquidity** and control over your funds throughout the year.\n* No IRS penalties if safe harbor rules are strictly followed.\n* Fairly easy to manage with modern tools (EFTPS, brokerage accounts, tax software reporting).\n\n# Risks &amp; Downsides (that I'm aware of):\n\n* More manual effort and complexity vs. passive W-2 withholding.\n* Must carefully track IRS and state quarterly deadlines.\n* Possible complexity around RSU income spikes or uneven cash flows (requiring annualized payments via IRS Form 2210-AI).\n* Slight risk of IRS misattributing payments (mitigated by EFTPS and careful record-keeping). Potentially not any more risky than usual method of withholding.\n\n# Where I'd Like Your Input:\n\n1. Have any of you implemented something similar successfully?\n2. What potential IRS or state tax \"gotchas\" am I overlooking, if any?\n3. Does this strategy scale meaningfully at higher income levels?\n4. Does this approach add significant complexity when filing via TurboTax or other software that I'm overlooking?", "score": 0, "num_comments": 37, "created_utc": 1744783883.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1k0djlm/tax_float_arbitrage_earning_riskfree_interest_by/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1k0djlm/tax_float_arbitrage_earning_riskfree_interest_by/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

Now, there is news all over the place that this assumption could be broken.\n\nWhat can I do to hedge against my entire life's savings losing value? Here are some ideas I can think of, along with the downside of each, but I want to hear from the FIRE community:\n\n1. Long LEAP PUTs on SPX. Hedges against a huge, and long-lasting market downturn, but the downside is: it's still collected in USD, which could mean actual purchasing power is still lost. (Equivalently, /ES or something similar to SPX.)\n2. Buying $GLD or $SLV. The downside is they're traded on US exchanges which might lose liquidity if there is an investor flight from the US.\n3. Buying \"Xetra-Gold,\" which is (I'm not familiar) supposedly a Gold ETF traded in Euros. Downside is it requires an international brokerage account, which I'm not sure how to open.\n4. Buying cryptocurrencies. Downside is I'm buying cryptocurrencies, which are not safe haven investments.\n5. Buy real (appreciating) assets, like a house. Inflation is (sort of) great for reducing your USD debt. Downside is your lasts-forever costs, like property tax, are still priced in the inflated USD.\n6. Straight up buying other currencies, like EUR, JPY, GDP, CNH/CNY, CAD, or something else.\n7. Buying physical gold, silver, etc.\n\nLooking to hear from you. No politics (rule 4).

I’m drawn to things like:\n\n* Freelance and small creative business (illustration, stationery, comics, content creation).\n* Things of interest such as fine arts, storytelling, interior design/ set design, architecture, creating stories/concepts for animations/ comics/ short film, games, film (directing, concept, writing and cinematography), photography, event, exhibition design, experimental marketing. Creating a indie story game, things that allow me to express myself and my unique ideas and world building...   \n* Living closer to nature or even hobby homesteading one day.\n* I love to travel and want to learn more and work with nature, maybe even conservation (but I think that makes no money) and I need to have better health first to constantly travel.\n* Hosting art/wellness workshops or community-based projects\n* Eventually having passive income (e.g. rentals, digital products) to take financial pressure off my health\n\nBut I’m stuck on how to realistically get there while being able to heal and manage my wellbeing.

Haven't done this before, but my understanding is this is basically the same as step 2 of the backdoor roth - the only difference is it's converting from a 401(k) with pre-tax dollars instead of from a traditional IRA with non-deductible post-tax dollars. \n\nDidn't find much explicit about this online (and will probably only be an issue this year, since no more backdoor roth going forward), so figured I'd double check my thinking here.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1744248264.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1jvm7uk/backdoor_roth_and_roth_conversion_in_same_year/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jvm7uk/backdoor_roth_and_roth_conversion_in_same_year/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

However, the biggest risk for bonds is inflation risk. TIPS provide a hedge against this, adjusting their principle for inflation.\n\n- Right now, TIPS provide an inflation adjusted yield from 2.05%(10 year) to 2.55%(30 year), depending on duration.\n\n- Based on these numbers, the break even inflation rate compared to regular 30 year bonds is 2.2%. The historical inflation rate is 3.8%, and most economists expect recent economic policies to increase inflation, so this is a really good deal.\n\n- Over the long term, you could potentially achieve higher returns than this, by selling bonds as they are closer to maturity, and buying ones with maturities further out with higher yields.\n\n- Even with all the uncertainty going on right now, the stock market trades at historically high valuations associated with lower returns. Historically, when P/E was at or above current valuations, the SP500 has always returned less than 2% annually over the following decade.  So you are not likely giving up much returns by including TIPS.\n\n- Overall, TIPS provide reliable income that adjusts for inflation. If you found yourself panicking during the last week, it may be a sign that your asset allocation is too aggressive, and you may want to consider safer assets. We will almost certainly face more uncertainty, so now is a good opportunity to prepare.\n\n- This is not a post advocating for market timing, or selling all of your stocks, but rather, one that argues that TIPS play an import role in a portfolio.

I read you need to move to more conservative investments as you get closer to retirement - is this as simple as calling fidelity and asking them to do this?

Anything else to keep in mind?\n\nHealth insurance advice? Maybe this is more philosophical but how do you pick health insurance or even decide to baristafire?\n\nHow do you leave work? Maybe again philosophical, but should I just sandbag until they fire me? Is that a horrible idea (ethically and bite-me-in-the-ass-later speaking)?\n\nOur rough finances are outlined below.

{"id": "1jrrw2z", "title": "Where are my Blindspots", "author": "Apprehensive-Part920", "text": "This is my first major post on Reddit.  I appreciate everyone's patients and guidance.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to prepare for retiring early and make sure I have thought through as much as possible to mitigate risk and maximize the chances of success. Sorry, it is long.\n\nBackground:\n\nI am 35m and my wife is 36f.  We have 2 kids (5m and 7f).  I am an Equity Portfolio Manager currently managing about $1.3 billion and my wife is a retired registered nurse that still has her license for family employment insurance purposes (i.e. if I lose my job and/or we get hit hard by markets she can mitigate those losses by going back to work).\n\nWe have $2 million in liquid investible assets (After the current drop) and 3 investment properties with an asset value of about $650,000 and an equity value (after debt) of about $300,000.  So, the total investable assets is $2.3 million.  The investment real estate cash flows (after taxes, which should decrease in retirement) is about $20,000 annually.  Total expenses assuming FAT FIRE is expected to be $120,000 annually.  These expenses can be taken down to just normal FIRE of around $105,000 and LEAN FIRE of $95,000.  These expense numbers have reserves built in for car replacement/maintenance, house maintenance, etc.  In anticipation of recent volatility, we are 70% short term treasuries/cash and the rest in equity (liquid investible assets).\n\nAdditionally, the company I work for is being acquired and since I am an equity holder, I will be paid out in May (this is included in liquid investible assets). A $8,000 bonus is coming in June or July, post-acquisition.\n\nMy son was diagnosed with Medulloblastoma (brain cancer) in 2022. He went through chemo and then he relapsed in 2023.  The second treatment (radiation) was completed at the end of 2023.  Treatment was at St. Jude which is completely free (St. Jude is amazing).  He has been cancer free for 1.25 years.  After 2 years of being cancer free the chance of relapse declines to under 5%.  Going back to the acquisition of the company I work for, my health insurance is transitioning to the new companies likely at the end of May, so it is my understanding that COBRA for the old plan will not be available, though if I leave after the transition to the new insurance I would be able to get COBRA for the new insurance.  There is an HR meeting next week that may provide me with some more details.  Obviously, I want zero lapse in health insurance and am willing to have double coverage just to ensure no lapse.  So my plan is COBRA or the ACA marketplace.  I estimate for the balance of the year $3,000 a month for family insurance and starting in 2026 $1500 a month (previous expense estimates utilize $1500.  I have $10,000 in extra cash to bridge the gap during 2025).\n\nThoughts:\n\nI am planning on retiring in May or June of this year.  My thought process since my sons diagnosis is time with my kids is fleeting especially if god forbid the worst case scenario happens to him.  So, though I am not quite at the 25x rule, I am willing to take the risk of my wife or I having to go back to work in a decade because we ran out of money, to spend time with my kids and family now.  My fundamental belief at this point is that the risk of missing out on spending time with my kids and family is higher than my risk of having to go back to work because my wealth starts to dwindle.\n\nQuestions:\n\nAre there opportunities to optimize my health insurance plan?  This part of my plan is the most important and also the part of my plan I am the most uncomfortable with.\n\nI plan to negotiate a severance (though I have no idea the probability of success or the potential payout).  I am willing to stay on and transition a new employee and train them for my role (my leverage) but would need significant flexibility via continual work from home and decrease in ancillary responsibility, etc.  Any thoughts, ideas, advice on severance?\n\nHere are some of my timing challenges.  Ideally, I want to be done at the end of May to have the whole summer off with my kids.  However, insurance does not cut over to the new insurance until the end of May and if I want to offer a transition period for severance, I need to give them notice.  So, if I start the severance negotiations in the beginning of May (post-acquisition), I risk being let go immediately and missing the new health insurance COBRA.  I am not sure how detrimental that scenario would be as I am in the dark on what the new insurance is and how that compares to the ACA marketplace.  My son’s next MRI scans are at the end of June and every 3 months.  Since the scans are going to be at St. Jude it will not cost us anything with or without insurance. Also, I am risking the $8,000 bonus if I start any negotiations prior to it being paid.  So, with that said, any ideas on how to improve my thought process around timing or anything I am overlooking?\n\nIs there anything I am not thinking about that I should be?\n\nWhat are my blindspots?\n\nFeel free to ask, if you need me to clarify anything.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1743815611.0, "permalink": "/r/financialindependence/comments/1jrrw2z/where_are_my_blindspots/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jrrw2z/where_are_my_blindspots/", "subreddit": "financialindependence"}

I Believe I will hit my CoastFI in 1-2 years and can maybe decrease time spent in my business and make less? However I dont think it’s likely as I will not be able to ignore items on my off day and stuff always happens. \n* According to FIRE calculator, I will hit my FIRE number in 8-10 years.  (Using 7% annualized ROI and between 3-4% SWR)\n   * [https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=38&amp;initsav=2000000&amp;spend=160000&amp;initinc=360000&amp;wr=3&amp;ir=0&amp;retspend=200000&amp;stockpct=80&amp;fixpct=18&amp;cashpct=2&amp;graph=fix&amp;secgraph=0&amp;stockrtn=8.1&amp;bondrtn=2.4&amp;MCstockrtn=0.081&amp;MCbondrtn=0.024&amp;tax=7&amp;income=0&amp;incstart=50&amp;incend=70&amp;expense=0&amp;expstart=50&amp;expend=70](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=38&amp;initsav=2000000&amp;spend=160000&amp;initinc=360000&amp;wr=3&amp;ir=0&amp;retspend=200000&amp;stockpct=80&amp;fixpct=18&amp;cashpct=2&amp;graph=fix&amp;secgraph=0&amp;stockrtn=8.1&amp;bondrtn=2.4&amp;MCstockrtn=0.081&amp;MCbondrtn=0.024&amp;tax=7&amp;income=0&amp;incstart=50&amp;incend=70&amp;expense=0&amp;expstart=50&amp;expend=70)\n* Pros: Having a purpose and something to do.

Current industry conditions suck, vendors cutting commission, pulling out of market, clients complaining about prices, etc…It will pass but getting negative energy from all sides. \n\n**Path 2 - Reduce hours and live early**\n\n* Find someone to take over or grind toward stepping away as much as I can.
